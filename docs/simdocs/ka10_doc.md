 Introduction
============

Originally the DEC PDP10 computer started as the PDP6. This was a 36 bit
computer that was designed for timesharing, which was introduced in
1964. The original goal of the machine was to allow for processing of
many 6 bit characters at a time. 36 bits were also common in machines
like the IBM 7090, GE 645, and Univac 11xx lines. Several systems
influenced the design of the PDP6, like CTSS, Lisp, support for larger
memory. The PDP6 was canceled by DEC due to production problems. The
engineers designed a smaller replacement, which happened to be a 36 bit
computer that looked very much like the PDP6. This was called the PDP10.
Later renamed to \"DECSystem-10\". The system supported up to 256K words
of memory.

The first PDP10 was labeled KA10, and added a few instructions to the
PDP6. Both the PDP6 and PDP10 used a base and limit relocation scheme.
The KA10 generally offered two registers, one of user data and the
second for user shared code. These were referred to the Low-Segment and
High-Segment, the High-Segment could be shared with several jobs. The
next version was called KI10 for Integrated. This added support for
paging and double precision floating point instructions. It also added 4
sets of registers to improve context switching time. It could also
support up to 4Mega words of memory. Following the KI10 was the KL10
(for Low-Cost). The KL10 added double precision integer instructions and
instructions to improve COBOL performance. This was the first version
which was microcoded. The KL10 was extended to support user programs
larger then 256k. The final version to make it to market was the KS10
(for Small), this was a bit-slice version of the PDP10 which used UNIBUS
devices which were cheaper then the KL10 devices.

The original operating system for the PDP6/PDP10 was just called
\"Monitor\". It was designed to fit into 6K words. Around the 3rd
release Swapping was added. The 6\'th release saw the addition of
virtual memory. Around the 4\'th release it was given the name
\"TOPS-10\". Around this time BBN was working on a paging system and
implemented it on the PDP10. This was called \"Tenex\". This was later
adopted by DEC and became \"Tops-20\".

During the mid 60\'s a group at MIT, who where not happy with how
Multics was being developed decided to create their own operating system
which they called Incompatible Timesharing System \"ITS\", was a play on
the original project called Compatible Timesharing System \"CTSS\". CTSS
was implemented by MIT on their IBM 7090 as an experimental system that
allowed multiple time sharing users to co-exist on the same machine
running batch processing. Hence the term Compatable.

Also during the mid 60\'s a group at Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (SAIL), started with a version of TOPS-10 and heavily
modified it to become WAITS.

During the 70\'s Tymshare starting with DEC TOPS-10 system modified it
to support random access files, paging with working sets and spawn-able
processes. This ran on the KI10, KL10 and KS10.

The PDP10 was ultimately replaced by the VAX.

  ATTACH \<device\> *\<port\>*   set up listening port
  ------------------------------ -----------------------

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used other TCP/IP activities.

Once attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens for
connections on the specified port. It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connections. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET \<device\> DISCONNECT
command,or a DETACH \<device\> command.

  ------------------------------- ---------------------
  SET \<device\> DISCONNECT=*n*   Disconnect line *n*

 Network Devices.
----------------

###  IMP Interface Message Processor (Device 460)

This allows the KA/KI to connect to the Internet. Currently only
supported under ITS. ITS and other OS that used the IMP did not support
modern protocols and typically required a complete rebuild to change the
IP address. Because of this the IMP processor includes built in NAT and
DHCP support. For ITS the system generated IP packets which are
translated to the local network. If the HOST is set to 0.0.0.0 there
will be no translation. If HOST is set to an IP address then it will be
mapped into the address set in IP. If DHCP is enabled the IMP will issue
a DHCP request at startup and set IP to the address that is provided.
DHCP is enabled by default.

  -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SET IMP MAC=*xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx*                    Set the MAC address of the IMP to the value given.
  SET IMP IP=*ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd*/*dd*                  Set the external IP address of the IMP along with the net mask in bits.
  SET IMP GW=*ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd*                       Set the Gateway address for the IMP.
  SET IMP HOST=*ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd*                     Sets the IP address of the PDP10 system.
  SET IMP DHCP                                       Allows the IMP to acquire an IP address from the local network via DHCP. Only HOST must be set if this feature is used.

  -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IMP device must be attached to an available Ethernet interface. To
determine which devices are available use the "SHOW ETHERNET" to list
the potential interfaces. Check out the "0readme\_ethernet.txt" from the
top of the source directory.

The IMP device can be configured in several ways. Ether it can connect
directly to an ethernet port (via TAP) or it can be connected via a TUN
interface. If configured via TAP interface the IMP will behave like any
other ethernet interface and if asked grab it's own address. In
environments where this is not desired the TUN interface can be used.
When configured under a TUN interface the simulated network is a
collection of ports on the local host. These can be mapped based on
configuration options, see the 0readme\_ethernet.txt file as to options.

With the IMP interface, the IP address of the simulated system is
static, and under ITS is configured into the system at compile time.
This address should be given to the IMP with the "set imp host=\<ip\>",
the IMP will direct all traffic it sees to this address. If this address
is not the same as the address of the system as seen by the network,
then this address can be set with "set imp ip=\<ip\>", and "set imp
gw=\<ip\>", or "set imp dhcp" which will allow the IMP to request an
address from a local DHCP server. The IMP will translate the packets it
receives/sends to look like the appeared from the desired address. The
IMP will also correctly translate FTP requests in this configuration.

When running under a TUN interface, IMP is on a virtual 10.0.2.0"
network. The default gateway is "10.0.2.1", with the default IMP at
"10.0.2.15". For this mode DHCP can be used.

###  CH Chaosnet interface (Device 470)

Chaos net was another methods of network access for ITS. Chaosnet can be
connected to another ITS system or a VAX/PDP11 running BSD Unix or VMS.
Chaosnet runs over UDP protocol under UNIX. You must specify a node
number, peer to talk to and your local UDP listening port. All UDP
packets are sent to the peer for further processing.

  ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------
  SET CH NODE=*n*                      Set the Node number for this system.
  SET CH PEER=*ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd:dddd*   Set the Peer address and port number.
  ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------

The CH device must be attached to a UDP port number. This is where it
will receive UDP packets from it's peer.

 PDP6 Devices.
-------------

These devices could be attached to the KA10. Stanford WAITS used them.
Early versions of TOPS10 could also run with these devices. By default
these devices are disabled.

###  DCT Type 136 Data Control (Device 200/204)

This device acted as a data multiplexer for the Dectape/Magtape and
Disk. Individual devices could be assigned channels on this device.
Devices which use the DCT include a DCT option with takes two octal
digits, the first is the DCT device 0 or 1, the second is the channel 1
to 7.

###  DTC Type 551 Dectape controller (Device 210)

This was the standard Dectape controller for the PDP6. This controller
loads the tape into memory and uses the buffered version. You need to
specify which DCT unit and channel the tape is connected to.

  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------
  SET DTC DCT=uc   Sets the DTC to connect to DCT unit and channel.
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------

Each individual tape drive support several options:

  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------
  SET DTC*n* LOCKED        Sets the mag tape to be read only.
  SET DTC*n* WRITEENABLE   Sets the mag tape to be writable.
  SET DTC*n* 18b           Default, tapes are considered to be 18bit tapes.
  SET DTC*n* 16b           Tapes are converted from 16 bit to 18bit.
  SET DTC*n* 12b           Tapes are converted from 12 bit to 18bit.
  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------

###  MTC Type 516 Magtape controller (Device 220)

This was the standard Magtape controller for the PDP6. This device
handled only 7 track tapes. The simulator has the option to
automatically translate 8 track tapes into 7 track tapes. You need to
specify which DCT unit and channel the tape is connected to.

  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------
  SET MTC DCT=uc   Sets the MTC to connect to DCT unit and channel.
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------

Each individual tape drive support several options:

  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------
  SET MTC*n* LOCKED        Sets this unit to be read only.
  SET MTC*n* WRITEENABLE   Sets this unit to be writable.
  SET MTC*n* 9T            Sets this unit to simulated 9 track format.
  SET MTC*n* 7T            Sets this unit to read/write 7 track tapes (with parity)
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------

###  DSK Type 270 Disk controller (Device 270)

The 270 disk could support up to 4 units. The controller had to be
connected to a type 136 Data Controller. You need to specify which DCT
unit and channel the disk is connected to.

  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------
  SET DSK DCT=uc   Sets the DSK to connect to DCT unit and channel.
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------

Each individual disk drive support several options:

  ------------------------ ---------------------------------
  SET DSK*n* LOCKED        Sets this unit to be read only.
  SET DSK*n* WRITEENABLE   Sets this unit to be writable.
  ------------------------ ---------------------------------

###  DCS Type 630 Terminal Multiplexer (Device 300)

See section on terminal multiplexers on generic setup.

 Symbolic Display and Input
==========================

The KA10 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are
controlled by the following switches to the EXAMINE and DEPOSIT
commands:

  ---- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -v   Looks up the address via translation, will return nothing if address is not valid.
  -u   With the -v option, used user space instead of executive space.
  -a   Display/Enter ASCII data.
  -p   Display/Enter packed ASCII data.
  -c   Display/Enter Sixbit Character data.
  -m   Display/Enter Symbolic instructions
       Display/Enter Octal data.
  ---- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symbolic instructions can be of the formats:

-   Opcode ac,operand

-   Opcode operands

-   I/O Opcode device,address

Operands can be one or more of the following in order:

-   Optional @ for indirection.

-   \+ or -- to set sign.

-   Octal number

-   Optional (ac) for indexing.

Breakpoints can be set at real memory address. The PDP10 supports 3
types of breakpoints. Execution, Memory Access and Memory Modify. The
default is execution. Adding -R to the breakpoint command will stop the
simulator on access to that memory location, either via fetch,
indirection or operand access. Adding -w will stop the simulator when
the location is modified.

The simulator can load RIM files, SAV files, EXE files, Waits Octal DMP
files, MIT SBLK files.

When instruction history is enabled, the history trace shows internal
status of various registers at the start of the instruction execution.

  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  PC      Shows the PC of the instruction executed.
  AC      The contents of the referenced AC.
  EA      The final computed Effective address.
  AR      Generally the operand that was computed.
  RES     The AR register after the instruction was complete.
  FLAGS   The values of the FLAGS register before execution of the instruction.
  IR      The fetched instruction followed by the disassembled instruction.
  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The PDP10 simulator allows for Memory reference and memory modify
breakpoints with the -r and -w options given to the break command.

 OS specific configurations
==========================

 TOPS10
------

The default configuration supports Tops10 so there is no extra
configuration required.

 ITS
---

To run ITS the CPU must be "set cpu ITS MPX 1024K", this will enable the
ITS pager, special instructions and the interrupt multiplexer. DK should
be disabled, along with all Mass bus devices. The following devices
should be enabled, PD, (also optionally) DPY, STK, TK, MTY, TEN11,
AUXCPU, IMP, CH. ITS used a second interrupt multiplexer so some devices
need to be configured to specific channels. TM10 (MTA) was at MPX=7,
Dectapes (DT) was at MPX=6, The IMP was at MPX=4.

 WAITS
-----

Waits has two configurations, one uses the default two relocation
registers. This can be done with "set cpu waits maoff", The PMP disk is
the only supported disk. Waits used some PDP6 devices (DTC,MTC,DCS,DTC).
Also the following special devices for Waits should be enabled (DKB,
III). The DTC should be configured to "dct=02", and the MTC should be
configured to "dct=01". After 1975 Stanford added a BBN pager unit to
their KA, to run later versions of WAITS, "set cpu waits maoff bbn
512k". The "waits" flag enables the FIX and XCTR instructions for waits.
"maoff" moves the trap vectors to the 0140. For systems numbers over 49,
BBN pager needs to also be enabled on the CPU.
