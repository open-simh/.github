#  Introduction

Originally the DEC PDP10 computer started as the PDP6. This was a 36 bit
computer that was designed for timesharing, which was introduced in
1964. The original goal of the machine was to allow for processing of
many 6 bit characters at a time. 36 bits were also common in machines
like the IBM 7090, GE 645, and Univac 11xx lines. Several systems
influenced the design of the PDP6, like CTSS, Lisp, support for larger
memory. The PDP6 was canceled by DEC due to production problems. The
engineers designed a smaller replacement, which happened to be a 36 bit
computer that looked very much like the PDP6. This was called the PDP10.
Later renamed to "DECSystem-10". The system supported up to 256K words
of memory.

The first PDP10 was labeled KA10, and added a few instructions to the
PDP6. Both the PDP6 and PDP10 used a base and limit relocation scheme.
The KA10 generally offered two registers, one of user data and the
second for user shared code. These were referred to the Low-Segment and
High-Segment, the High-Segment could be shared with several jobs. The
next version was called KI10 for Integrated. This added support for
paging and double precision floating point instructions. It also added 4
sets of registers to improve context switching time. It could also
support up to 4Mega words of memory. Following the KI10 was the KL10
(for Low-Cost). The KL10 added double precision integer instructions and
instructions to improve COBOL performance. This was the first version
which was microcoded. The KL10 was extended to support user programs
larger then 256k. The final version to make it to market was the KS10
(for Small), this was a bit-slice version of the PDP10 which used UNIBUS
devices which were cheaper then the KL10 devices.

The original operating system for the PDP6/PDP10 was just called
"Monitor". It was designed to fit into 6K words. Around the 3rd release
Swapping was added. The 6'th release saw the addition of virtual memory.
Around the 4'th release it was given the name "TOPS-10". Around this
time BBN was working on a paging system and implemented it on the PDP10.
This was called "Tenex". This was later adopted by DEC and became
"Tops-20".

During the mid 60's a group at MIT, who where not happy with how Multics
was being developed decided to create their own operating system which
they called Incompatible Timesharing System "ITS", was a play on the
original project called Compatible Timesharing System "CTSS". CTSS was
implemented by MIT on their IBM 7090 as an experimental system that
allowed multiple time sharing users to co-exist on the same machine
running batch processing. Hence the term Compatable.

Also during the mid 60's a group at Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (SAIL), started with a version of TOPS-10 and heavily
modified it to become WAITS.

During the 70's Tymshare starting with DEC TOPS-10 system modified it to
support random access files, paging with working sets and spawn-able
processes. This ran on the KI10, KL10 and KS10.

The PDP10 was ultimately replaced by the VAX.

##  Terminal Multiplexer I/O Devices

All terminal multiplexers must be attached in order to work. The ATTACH
command specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

|                              |                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ATTACH \<device\> *\<port\>* | set up listening port |

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used other TCP/IP activities.

Once attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens for
connections on the specified port. It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connections. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET \<device\> DISCONNECT
command,or a DETACH \<device\> command.

|                               |                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| SET \<device\> DISCONNECT=*n* | Disconnect line *n* |

The \<device\> implements the following special SHOW commands

|                             |                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| SHOW \<device\> CONNECTIONS | Displays current connections to the \<device\> |
| SHOW \<device\> STATISTICS  | Displays statistics for active connections     |
| SHOW \<device\> LOG         | Display logging for all lines.                 |

Logging can be controlled as follows:

|                                   |                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| SET \<device\> LOG=*n*=*filename* | Log output of line *n* to *filename* |
| SET \<device\> NOLOG              | Disable logging and close log file   |

###  D**Z11** Terminal Controller 

The DZ device was the standard terminal multiplexer for the KS10. Lines
came in groups of 8. A max of 32 lines can be supported.

|                   |                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| SET DZ LINES=*n*  | Set the number of lines on the DZ10, multiple of 8.  |
| SET DZ ADDR=value | Sets the Unibus address of device. (default: 760000) |
| SET DZ VECT=value | Sets the interrupt vector of device. (default: 340)  |
| SET DZ BR=value   | Sets the interrupt priority of device. (default: 5)  |
| SET DZ CTL=value  | Sets the Unibus adapter number. (default: 3)         |

##  Network Devices.

###  IMP Interface Message Processor

This allows the KS to connect to the Internet. Currently only supported
under ITS. ITS and other OS that used the IMP did not support modern
protocols and typically required a complete rebuild to change the IP
address. Because of this the IMP processor includes built in NAT and
DHCP support. For ITS the system generated IP packets which are
translated to the local network. If the HOST is set to 0.0.0.0 there
will be no translation. If HOST is set to an IP address then it will be
mapped into the address set in IP. If DHCP is enabled the IMP will issue
a DHCP request at startup and set IP to the address that is provided.
DHCP is enabled by default.

The IMP device must be attached to an available Ethernet interface. To
determine which devices are available use the “SHOW ETHERNET” to list
the potential interfaces. Check out the “0readme\_ethernet.txt” from the
top of the source directory.

The IMP device can be configured in several ways. Ether it can connect
directly to an ethernet port (via TAP) or it can be connected via a TUN
interface. If configured via TAP interface the IMP will behave like any
other ethernet interface and if asked grab it’s own address. In
environments where this is not desired the TUN interface can be used.
When configured under a TUN interface the simulated network is a
collection of ports on the local host. These can be mapped based on
configuration options, see the 0readme\_ethernet.txt file as to options.

With the IMP interface, the IP address of the simulated system is
static, and under ITS is configured into the system at compile time.
This address should be given to the IMP with the “set imp host=\<ip\>”,
the IMP will direct all traffic it sees to this address. If this address
is not the same as the address of the system as seen by the network,
then this address can be set with “set imp ip=\<ip\>”, and “set imp
gw=\<ip\>”, or “set imp dhcp” which will allow the IMP to request an
address from a local DHCP server. The IMP will translate the packets it
receives/sends to look like the appeared from the desired address. The
IMP will also correctly translate FTP requests in this configuration.

When running under a TUN interface, IMP is on a virtual 10.0.2.0”
network. The default gateway is “10.0.2.1”, with the default IMP at
“10.0.2.15”. For this mode DHCP can be used.

###  CH11 Chaosnet interface

Chaos net was another methods of network access for ITS. Chaosnet can be
connected to another ITS system or a VAX/PDP11 running BSD Unix or VMS.
Chaosnet runs over UDP protocol under UNIX. You must specify a node
number, peer to talk to and your local UDP listening port. All UDP
packets are sent to the peer for further processing.

The CH device must be attached to a UDP port number. This is where it
will receive UDP packets from it’s peer.

###  KMC11 communications controller.

The KMC11-A is a general purpose microprocessor that is used in several
DEC products. The KDP is an emulation of one of those products: COMM
IOP-DUP. The COMM IOP-DUP microcode controls and supervises 1 - 16
DUP-11 synchronous communications line interfaces, providing
scatter/gather DMA, message framing, modem control, CRC validation,
receiver resynchronization, and address recognition. The DUP-11 lines
are assigned to the KMC11 by the (emulated) operating system, but SimH
must be told how to connect them.

###  **DUP11 network** interface

Dup11 devices are used by DECNET to link machines together. They are a
synchronous serial interface. This is implemented by UDP to send packets
to the remote machine.

|                            |                                                         |

| SET DUP LINES=*n*          | Sets number of DUP 11 lines supported current max is 2. |
| SET DUPn SPEED=bits/sec    | Set speed of link, default of 0 means no restrictions.  |
| SET DUPn CORRUPTION=factor | Specify corruption factor.                              |
| SET DUPn W3                | Enable Reset option                                     |
| SET DUPn NOW3              | Disable reset option                                    |
| SET DUPn W5                | Enable A dataset control option.                        |
| SET DUPn NOW5              | Disable A dataset control option.                       |

| SET DUPn NOW6              | Disable A & B dataset control option.                   |
| SET DUP ADDR=value         | Sets the Unibus address of device. (default: 760300)    |
| SET DUP VECT=value         | Sets the interrupt vector of device. (default: 570)     |
| SET DUP BR=value           | Sets the interrupt priority of device. (default: 5)     |
| SET DUP CTL=value          | Sets the Unibus adapter number. (default: 3)            |

The DUP device must be attached to a UDP port number. This is where it
will receive UDP packets from it’s peer.

Attach

The communication line performs input and output through a TCP session
(or UDP session) connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command
specifies the port to be used as well as the peer address:

sim\> ATTACH DUP0 {interface:}port{,UDP},Connect=peerhost:port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Specifying symmetric attach configuration (with both a listen port and a
peer address) will cause the side receiving an incoming connection to
validate that the connection actually comes from the connecction
destination system.

A symmetric attach configuration is required when using UDP packet
transport.

The default connection uses TCP transport between the local system and
the peer. Alternatively, UDP can be used by specifying UDP on the ATTACH
command.

For more connection options, view the Help attach command for the DUP.

#  Symbolic Display and Input

The KL10 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are
controlled by the following switches to the EXAMINE and DEPOSIT
commands:

|     |                                                                                    |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \-v | Looks up the address via translation, will return nothing if address is not valid. |
| \-u | With the -v option, used user space instead of executive space.                    |
| \-a | Display/Enter ASCII data.                                                          |
| \-p | Display/Enter packed ASCII data.                                                   |
| \-c | Display/Enter Sixbit Character data.                                               |
| \-m | Display/Enter Symbolic instructions                                                |
|     | Display/Enter Octal data.                                                          |

Symbolic instructions can be of the formats:

  - Opcode ac,operand

  - Opcode operands

  - I/O Opcode device,address

Operands can be one or more of the following in order:

  - Optional @ for indirection.

  - \+ or – to set sign.

  - Octal number

  - Optional (ac) for indexing.

Breakpoints can be set at real memory address. The PDP10 supports 3
types of breakpoints. Execution, Memory Access and Memory Modify. The
default is execution. Adding -R to the breakpoint command will stop the
simulator on access to that memory location, either via fetch,
indirection or operand access. Adding -w will stop the simulator when
the location is modified.

The simulator can load RIM files, SAV files, EXE files, Waits Octal DMP
files, MIT SBLK files.

When instruction history is enabled, the history trace shows internal
status of various registers at the start of the instruction execution.

| EA    | The final computed Effective address.                                 |
| AR    | Generally the operand that was computed.                              |
| RES   | The AR register after the instruction was complete.                   |
| FLAGS | The values of the FLAGS register before execution of the instruction. |
| IR    | The fetched instruction followed by the disassembled instruction.     |

The PDP10 simulator allows for Memory reference and memory modify
breakpoints with the -r and -w options given to the break command.

#  OS specific configurations

##  ITS

To run ITS the CPU must be “set cpu ITS”, this will enable the ITS
pager.
