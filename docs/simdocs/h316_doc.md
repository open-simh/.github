The H316/H516 simulator implements several unique stop conditions:

- Decode of an undefined instruction, and STOP_INST is set

- Reference to an undefined I/O device, and STOP_DEV is set

- More than INDMAX indirect references are detected during memory
  reference address decoding

- DMA/DMC direction does not agree with I/O device operation

- A write operation is initiated on a write locked magnetic tape unit
  (hangs the real system)

- A disk write overruns the specified record size (destroys the rest
  of the track on the real system)

- A disk track has an illegal format

The LOAD and DUMP commands are not implemented.

## CPU

CPU options include choice of instruction set, memory size, DMC option,
and number of DMA channels.

| Command       | Function                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| SET CPU HSA   | high speed arithmetic instructions    |
| SET CPU NOHSA | no high speed arithmetic instructions |
| SET CPU 4K    | set memory size = 4K                  |
| SET CPU 8K    | set memory size = 8K                  |
| SET CPU 12K   | set memory size = 12K                 |
| SET CPU 16K   | set memory size = 16K                 |
| SET CPU 24K   | set memory size = 24K                 |
| SET CPU 32K   | set memory size = 32K                 |
| SET CPU DMC   | enable DMC option                     |
| SET CPU NODMC | disable DMC option                    |
| SET CPU DMA=n | set number of DMA channels to n (0-4) |

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 32K. By
default, the HSA and DMC options are enabled, and four DMA channels are
configured.

### Extended Interrupts

The H316 came with one interrupt vector and 16 individually maskable
interrupt sources as standard but could optionally be extended to
support up to 48 additional individually maskable interrupt sources,
each with its own unique vector. Extended interrupts are enabled with
the command

SET CPU EXTINT=16

and the command

SET CPU EXTINT=0

restores the original default H316 single interrupt behavior. Note that
the IMP and TIP custom hardware required one additional bank of 16
interrupts.

Only 16 extended interrupts (out of a possible 48) are currently
implemented.

### DMA channels

The CPU includes special show commands to display the state of the DMA
channels:

SHOW CPU DMAn show DMA channel n

### Break on Write

The H316 emulation supports "break on memory write" breakpoints in
addition to the standard "break on execution" type. For example, the
command

BREAK --W 2000

will cause a break to occur any time memory location 2000~8~ is written.
All the usual simh break point options, including address ranges and
commands to be executed automatically upon breaking, work here too.

Break on write has two restrictions -- first, setting a write break on a
DMC channel pointer location, 20~8~ thru 57~8~, will break only on
explicit programmed writes to that address. Implicit DMC operations will
not cause a break. Second, remember that when _any_ break occurs simh
prints the PC and the instruction _after_ the one which actually caused
the break. It will always be the previous instruction which actually
modified the breakpoint location.

### CPU State

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

    SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer
    SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history
    SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n
    SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history
    SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 65,536 entries.

## Programmed I/O Devices

### 316/516-50 Paper Tape Reader (PTR)

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader can bet set to operate in binary, ASCII, or Unix
ASCII mode:

    SET PTR BINARY binary mode
    SET PTR ASCII ASCII mode
    SET PTR UASCII Unix ASCII mode

The mode can also be set by a switch setting in the ATTACH command:

    ATT --B PTR <file> binary mode
    ATT --A PTR <file> ASCII mode
    ATT --U PTR <file> Unix ASCII mode

In ASCII or Unix ASCII mode, all non-zero characters have the high order
bit forced on. In Unix ASCII mode, newline is converted to CR, and LF is
inserted as the following character.

The paper tape reader supports the BOOT command. BOOT PTR copies the
absolute binary loader into memory and starts it running.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

| name     | size | comments                              |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| BUF      | 8    | last data item processed              |
| INTREQ   | 1    | device interrupt request              |
| READY    | 1    | device ready                          |
| ENABLE   | 1    | device interrupts enabled             |
| POS      | 32   | position in the input file            |
| TIME     | 24   | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| STOP_IOE | 1    | stop on I/O error                     |

Error handling is as follows:

| error        | STOP_IOE    | processed as          |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| not attached | 1           | report error and stop |
| 0            | out of tape |
| end of file  | 1           | report error and stop |
| 0            | out of tape |
| OS I/O error | x           | report error and stop |

### 316/516-52 Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The paper tape punch can bet set to operate in binary, ASCII, or Unix
ASCII mode:

```
SET PTP BINARY          binary mode
SET PTP ASCII           ASCII mode
SET PTP UASCII          Unix ASCII mode
```

The mode can also be set by a switch setting in the ATTACH command:

```
ATT --B PTP <file>    binary mode
ATT --A PTP <file>    ASCII mode
ATT --U PTP <file>    Unix ASCII mode
```

In ASCII or Unix ASCII mode, all characters are masked to 7b before
being written to the output file. In Unix ASCII mode, LF is converted to
newline, and CR is discarded.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

| name     | size | comments                              |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| BUF      | 8    | last data item processed              |
| INTREQ   | 1    | device interrupt request              |
| READY    | 1    | device ready                          |
| ENABLE   | 1    | device interrupts enabled             |
| POWER    | 1    | device powered up                     |
| POS      | 32   | position in the output file           |
| TIME     | 24   | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| PWRTIME  | 24   | time from I/O request to power up     |
| STOP_IOE | 1    | stop on I/O error                     |

Error handling is as follows:

| error        | STOP_IOE    | processed as          |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| not attached | 1           | report error and stop |
| 0            | out of tape |
| OS I/O error | x           | report error and stop |

### 316/516-33 Console Teletype (TTY)

The console Teletype (TTY) consists of four separate units:

    TTY0                    keyboard
    TTY1                    printer
    TTY2                    paper tape reader
    TTY3                    paper tape punch

The keyboard and printer (TTY0, TTY1) can be set to one of four modes,
KSR, 7P, 7B, or 8B:

| mode | input characters                                       | output characters                                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| KSR  | lower case converted to upper case, high-order bit set | lower case converted to upper case, high-order bit cleared, non-printing characters suppressed |
| 7P   | high-order bit cleared                                 | high-order bit cleared, non-printing characters suppressed                                     |
| 7B   | high-order bit cleared                                 | high-order bit cleared                                                                         |
| 8B   | no changes                                             | no changes                                                                                     |

The default mode is KSR. The Teletype keyboard reads from the console
keyboard, and the printer writes to the simulator console window.

The paper tape reader (TTY2) can bet set to operate in binary, ASCII, or
Unix ASCII mode:

    SET TTY2 BINARY         binary mode
    SET TTY2 ASCII          ASCII mode
    SET TTY2 UASCII         Unix ASCII mode

The mode can also be set by a switch setting in the ATTACH command:

    ATT --B TTY2 <file>   binary mode
    ATT --A TTY2 <file>   ASCII mode
    ATT --U TTY2 <file>   Unix ASCII mode

In ASCII or Unix ASCII mode, all non-zero characters have the high order
bit forced on. In Unix ASCII mode, newline is converted to CR, and LF is
inserted as the following character.

The paper tape reader is started by program output of XON or by the
command SET TTY2 START. The paper tape reader is stopped by reader input
of XOFF or by the command SET TTY2 STOP.

The Teletype paper tape punch (TTY3) can bet set to operate in binary,
ASCII, or Unix ASCII mode:

    SET TTY3 BINARY         binary mode
    SET TTY3 ASCII          ASCII mode
    SET TTY3 UASCII         Unix ASCII mode

The mode can also be set by a switch setting in the ATTACH command:

```
ATT --B TTY3 <file>       binary mode
ATT --A TTY3 <file>       ASCII mode
ATT --U TTY3 <file>       Unix ASCII mode
```

In ASCII or Unix ASCII mode, all characters are masked to 7b before
being written to the output file. In Unix ASCII mode, LF is converted to
newline, and CR is discarded.

The Teletype paper tape punch is started by program output of TAPE or by
the command SET TTY3 START. The punch is stopped by program output of
XOFF or by the command SET TTY3 STOP.

The TTY implements these registers:

### 316/516-12 Real Time Clock (CLK)

The real time clock (CLK) frequency can be adjusted as follows:

    SET CLK 60HZ set frequency to 60Hz
    SET CLK 50HZ set frequency to 50Hz

The default is 60Hz.

The clock implements these registers:

| name   | size | comments                  |
| ------ | ---- | ------------------------- |
| INTREQ | 1    | device interrupt request  |
| READY  | 1    | device ready              |
| ENABLE | 1    | device interrupts enabled |
| TIME   | 24   | clock interval            |

The real-time clock autocalibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

Note that previous releases of simh did not allow the CLK device to be
disabled. However, this device was optional and it was possible to
configure an H316 system without one (although this apparently rarely
happened). Current simh releases will allow the CLK device to be
disabled. When the CLK device is disabled it does not respond to the
clock specific IO instructions; it does not increment location 61~8~,
and it does not generate interrupts. The SMK and OTK instructions are
unaffected.

## 316/516 Line Printer (LPT)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The line printer can be connected to the IO bus, a DMC channel, or a DMA
channel:

    SET LPT IOBUS           connect to IO bus
    SET LPT DMC=n           connect to DMC channel n (1-16)
    SET LPT DMA=n           connect to DMA channel n (1 to 4)

By default, the line printer is connected to the IO bus.

The line printer implements these registers:

| name     | size | comments                       |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------ |
| WDPOS    | 6    | word position in current scan  |
| DRPOS    | 6    | drum position                  |
| CRPOS    | 1    | carriage position              |
| PRDN     | 1    | print done flag                |
| RDY      | 1    | ready flag                     |
| EOR      | 1    | (DMA/DMC) end of range flag    |
| DMA      | 1    | transfer using DMA/DMC         |
| INTREQ   | 1    | device interrupt request       |
| ENABLE   | 1    | device interrupt enable        |
| SVCST    | 2    | service state                  |
| SVCCH    | 2    | service channel                |
| BUF      | 8    | buffer                         |
| POS      | 32   | position in the output file    |
| XTIME    | 24   | delay between transfers        |
| ETIME    | 24   | delay at end of scan           |
| PTIME    | 24   | delay for shuttle/line advance |
| STOP_IOE | 1    | stop on I/O error              |

Error handling is as follows:

| error        | STOP_IOE     | processed as          |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- |
| not attached | 1            | report error and stop |
| 0            | out of paper |
| OS I/O error | x            | report error and stop |

## 4400 Fixed Head Disk (FHD)

Fixed head disk options include the ability to set the number of
surfaces to a fixed value between 1 and 16, or to autosize the number of
surfaces from the attached file:

    SET FHD 1S              one surface (98K)
    SET FHD 2S              two platters (196K)
    :
    SET FHD 16S             sixteen surfaces (1568K)
    SET FHD AUTOSIZE        autosized on ATTACH

The default is one surface.

The fixed head disk can be connected to the IO bus, a DMC channel, or a
DMA channel:

    SET FHD IOBUS           connect to IO bus
    SET FHD DMC=n           connect to DMC channel n (1-16)
    SET FHD DMA=n           connect to DMA channel n (1 to 4)

By default, the fixed head disk is connected to the IO bus.

The fixed head disk implements these registers:

| name     | size | comments                                    |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| CW1      | 16   | control word 1 (read write, surface, track) |
| CW2      | 16   | control word 2 (character address)          |
| BUF      | 16   | data buffer                                 |
| BUSY     | 1    | controller busy flag                        |
| RDY      | 1    | transfer ready flag                         |
| DTE      | 1    | data transfer error flag                    |
| ACE      | 1    | access error flag                           |
| EOR      | 1    | (DMA/DMC) end of range                      |
| DMA      | 1    | transfer using DMA/DMC                      |
| CSUM     | 1    | transfer parity checksum                    |
| INTREQ   | 1    | device interrupt request                    |
| ENABLE   | 1    | device interrupt enable                     |
| TIME     | 24   | delay between words                         |
| STOP_IOE | 1    | stop on I/O error                           |

Error handling is as follows:

| error        | STOP_IOE       | processed as          |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| not attached | 1              | report error and stop |
| 0            | disk not ready |

Fixed head disk data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of
file and OS I/O errors cannot occur.

## 4100 7-track Magnetic Tape (MT)

Magnetic tape options include the ability to make units write enabled or
write locked.

    SET MTn LOCKED set     unit n write locked
    SET MTn WRITEENABLED   set unit n write enabled

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

    SET MTn CAPAC=m         set unit n capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)
    SHOW MTn CAPAC          show unit n capacity in MB

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The magnetic tape controller can be connected to the IO bus, a DMC
channel, or a DMA channel:

    SET MT IOBUS            connect to IO bus
    SET MT DMC=n            connect to DMC channel n (1-16)
    SET MT DMA=n            connect to DMA channel n (1 to 4)

By default, the magnetic tape controller is connected to the IO bus.

The magnetic tape controller implements these registers:

| name            | size | comments                      |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- |
| BUF             | 16   | data buffer                   |

| RDY             | 1    | transfer ready flag           |
| ERR             | 1    | error flag                    |
| EOF             | 1    | end of file flag              |
| EOR             | 1    | (DMA/DMC) end of range        |
| DMA             | 1    | transfer using DMA/DMC        |
| MDIRQ           | 1    | motion done interrupt request |
| INTREQ          | 1    | device interrupt request      |

| DBUF[0:65535]   | 8    | transfer buffer               |
| BPTR            | 17   | transfer buffer pointer       |
| BMAX            | 17   | transfer size (reads)         |
| CTIME           | 24   | start/stop time               |
| XTIME           | 24   | delay between words           |
| POS[0:3]        | 32   | position, units 0 to 3        |
| STOP_IOE        | 1    | stop on I/O error             |

Error handling is as follows:

| error        | processed as                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| not attached | tape not ready; if STOP_IOE, stop |
| end of file  | bad tape                          |
| OS I/O error | parity error; if STOP_IOE, stop   |

## 4623/4651/4720 Disk Packs (DP)

The disk controller can be configured as a 4623, supporting 10-surface
disk packs; a 4651, supporting 2-surface disk packs; or a 4720,
supporting 20-surface disk packs:

    SET DP 4623             controller is 4623
    SET DP 4651             controller is 4651
    SET DP 4720             controller is 4720

The default is 4651. All disk packs on the controller must be of the
same type.

Individual units can be write enabled or write locked:

    SET DPn LOCKED          set unit n write locked
    SET DPn WRITEENABLED    set unit n write enabled

Units can be also be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The disk pack controller can be connected to a DMC channel or a DMA
channel; it cannot be connected to the IO bus:

    SET DP DMC=n            connect to DMC channel n (1-16)
    SET DP DMA=n            connect to DMA channel n (1 to 4)

The disk pack controller supports variable track formatting. Each track
can contain between 1 and 103 records, with a minimum size of 1 word and
a maximum size of 1893 words. Record addresses are unconstrained. The
simulator provides a command to perform a simple, fixed record size
format of a new disk:

    SET DPn FORMAT=k        format unit n with k words per record
    SET -R DPn FORMAT=k     format unit n with k records per track

Record addresses can either be geometric (cylinder/track/sector) or
simple sequential starting from 0:

    SET DPn FORMAT=k        format with geometric record addresses
    SET -S DPn FORMAT=k     format with sequential record addresses

Geometric address have the cylinder number in bits<1:8>, the head
number in bits<9:13>, and the sector number in bits <14:16>.

A summary of the current format, and its validity, can be obtained with
the command:

    SHOW DPn FORMAT         display format of unit n

To accommodate the variable formatting, each track is allocated 2048
words in the data file. A record consists of a three word header, the
data, and a five word trailer:

    word 0               record length in words, not including header/trailer
    word 1               record address
    word 2               number of extension words used (0-4)
    word 3               start of data record
    word 3+n-1           end of data record
    word 3+n..7+n        record trailer: up to four extension words,
                         plus checksum

A record can "grow" by up to four words without disrupting the track
formatting; writing more than four extra words destroys the formatting
of the rest of the track and causes a simulator error.

The disk pack controller implements these registers:

| name         | size | comments                                   |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |

| BTIME        | 24   | controller busy time                       |

Error handling is as follows:

| error        | processed as                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| not atached  | pack off line; if STOP_IOE, stop |

# Symbolic Display and Input

The H316/H516 simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display
is controlled by command line switches:

    -a                      display as ASCII character
    -c                      display as two packed ASCII characters
    -m                      display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

    S' or -a                ASCII character
    " or -c                two packed ASCII characters
    alphabetic              instruction mnemonic
    numeric                 octal number

Instruction input uses standard H316/H516 assembler syntax. There are
six instruction classes: memory reference, I/O, control, shift, skip,
and operate.

Memory reference instructions have the format

    memref{*} {C/Z} address{,1}

where * signifies indirect, C a current sector reference, Z a sector
zero reference, and 1 indexed. The address is an octal number in the
range 0 - 077777; if C or Z is specified, the address is a page offset
in the range 0 - 0777. Normally, C is not needed; the simulator figures
out from the address what mode to use. However, when referencing memory
outside the CPU, there is no valid PC, and C must be used to specify
current sector addressing.

I/O instructions have the format

    io function,device

The function is an octal number in the range 0 - 17. The device is a
symbolic name (e.g., TTY) or an octal number in the range 0-77.

Control and operate instructions consist of a single opcode

    opcode

Shift instructions have the format

    shift n

where n is an octal number in the range 0-77.

Skip instructions have the format

    sub-op sub-op sub-op...

The simulator checks that the combination of sub-opcodes is legal.
