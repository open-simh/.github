Most devices can be disabled or enabled, by the commands:

SET \<dev\> DISABLED

SET \<dev\> ENABLED

The simulator allows most device numbers to be changed, by the command:

SET \<dev\> DEV=\<number\>

The PDP-8 can support only one of the set {DF32, RF08, RL8A} using the
default device numbers, since they all use device numbers 60-61. The
default is the RF08. To change the disk at device numbers 60-61:

SET RF DISABLED disable RF08

SET DF ENABLED, or enable DF32

SET RL ENABLED enable RL8A

The PDP-8 can only support one of the set {TC08, TD8E} using the default
device numbers, since both use device number 77. The default is the
TC08. To change the DECtape controller to the TD8E:

SET DT DISABLED disable TC08

SET TD ENABLED enable TD8E

The PDP-8 can only support one of the set {TM8E, TA8E} using the default
device numbers, since both use device number 70. The default is the
TM8E. To change the device at device number 70:

SET MT DISABLED disable TM8E

SET CT ENABLED enable TA8E

Alternately, the device conflict can be eliminated by changing device
numbers:

SET RL DEV=50

SET RL ENA

SET TD DEV=74

SET TD ENA

SET CT DEV=73

SET CT ENA

However, devices can only be BOOTed with their default device numbers.

The PDP-8 simulator implements several unique stop conditions:

  - If an undefined instruction (unimplemented IOT or OPR) is decoded,
    and STOP\_INST is set

  - If a simulated DECtape runs off the end of its reel

The LOAD command supports both RIM format and BIN format tapes. If the
file extension is .RIM, or the r switch is specified with LOAD, the file
is assumed to be RIM format; if the file extension is not .RIM, or the
-b switch is specified, the file is assumed to be BIN format. For BIN
format tape loading will stop at the first trailer code (0x80). If the
tape contains multiple sections specify the –a flag to load all sections
on the tape. The number of sections loaded will be printed. If the tape
had non BIN format data following the last valid leader it may cause
checksum errors or load unwanted data into memory.

## CPU

The only CPU options are the presence of the EAE and the size of main
memory; the memory extension and time-share control is always included,
even if memory size is 4K.

SET CPU EAE enable EAE

SET CPU NOEAE disable EAE

SET CPU 4K set memory size = 4K

SET CPU 8K set memory size = 8K

SET CPU 12K set memory size = 12K

SET CPU 16K set memory size = 16K

SET CPU 20K set memory size = 20K

SET CPU 24K set memory size = 24K

SET CPU 28K set memory size = 28K

SET CPU 32K set memory size = 32K

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 32K.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

PC 15 program counter, including IF as high 3 bits

AC 12 accumulator

MQ 12 multiplier-quotient

L 1 link

SR 12 front panel switches

IF 3 instruction field

The CPU attempts to detect when the simulator is idle. When idle, the
simulator does not use any resources on the host system. Idle detection
is controlled by the SET IDLE and SET NOIDLE commands:

SET CPU IDLE enable idle detection

SET CPU NOIDLE disable idle detection

Idle detection is disabled by default. At present, the CPU is considered
idle if it is executing a KSF/JMP \*-1 loop with interrupts disabled
(OS/8, DMS-8) or a JMP \* loop (TSS/8).

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 65536 entries.

## TSC8-75 ETOS Timeshare Control (TSC)

ETOS is a timeshared operating system for the PDP-8, providing multiple
virtual OS/8 environments for up to 32 users. It requires a special
timeshare control option, the TSC8-75. The TSC8-75 is normally disabled;
to run ETOS, it must be enabled with the command:

SET TSC ENABLED

The TSC8-75 implements these registers:

name size comments

IR 12 most recently trapped instruction

PC 12 PC of most recently trapped instruction

CDF 1 1 if trapped instruction is CDF, 0 otherwise

ENB 1 interrupt enable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

Except for operation of ETOS, the TSC8-75 should be left disabled.

## FPP8A Floating Point Unit (FPP)

The floating point unit (FPP) is an add-on device that provides floating
point capabilities. It operates as a coprocessor to the main CPU, with
its own program counter and instruction set. The FPP8A is normally
disabled; to use it, it must be enabled with the command:

SET FPP ENABLED

The FPP8A implements these registers:

name size comments

FPACE 12 floating AC exponent

FPAC0..4 12 floating AC fraction words 0..4

CMD 12 FPP command register

STA 12 FPP status register

APTA 15 APT address pointer

APTSVF 3 APT save field

FPC 15 FPP program counter

BRA 15 base register pointer

XRA 15 index register pointer

OPA 15 operand pointer

SSF 12 single step flag

LASTLOCK 12 last lock bit

FLAG 1 FPP flag

Except for environments that explicitly support it, the FPP8A should be
left disabled.

## Programmed I/O Devices

### PC8E Paper Tape Reader (PTR)

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader supports the BOOT command. BOOT PTR copies the RIM
loader into memory and starts it running.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 position in the input file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

end of file 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### PC8E Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### KL8E Terminal Input (TTI)

The terminal interfaces (TTI, TTO) can be set to one of four modes, KSR,
7B, 7B, or 8B:

mode input characters output characters

KSR lower case converted lower case converted to upper case,

to upper case, high-order bit cleared,

high-order bit set non-printing characters suppressed

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default mode is KSR.

The terminal input (TTI) polls the console keyboard for input. It
implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 number of characters input

TIME 24 input polling interval

The terminal input is normally polled synchronously with the real-time
clock. To avoid data loss, a poll is scheduled 'TIME' instructions after
the CPU reads a character.

### KL8E Terminal Output (TTO)

The terminal output (TTO) writes to the simulator console window. It
implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 number of characters output

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

### LE8E Line Printer (LPT)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be read or written. Thus,
by changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer. The
default position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing
file. A new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The line printer implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

ERR 1 error status flag

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### DK8E Line-Frequency Clock (CLK)

The real-time clock (CLK) frequency can be adjusted as follows:

SET CLK 60HZ set frequency to 60Hz

SET CLK 50HZ set frequency to 50Hz

SET CLK NORMAL set clock to calibrated timing

SET CLK DIAG set clock to fixed timing

The default is 60Hz.

The clock implements these registers:

name size comments

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

TIME 24 clock interval

The real-time clock autocalibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

### KL8JA Additional Terminals (TTIX, TTOX)

The simulator supports 1 to 16 additional terminals, with an initial
default of 4 lines. The additional terminals consist of two independent
devices, TTIX and TTOX. The entire set is modeled as a terminal
multiplexer, with TTIX as the master controller. The number of lines is
specified with a SET command:

SET TTIX LINES=n set number of additional lines to n \[1-16\]

The ATTACH command specifies the port to be used:

ATTACH TTIX \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. The additional terminals are disabled
by default.

The additional terminals can be set to one of four modes: UC, 7P, 7B, or
8B.

mode input characters output characters

UC lower case converted lower case converted to upper case,

to upper case, high-order bit cleared,

high-order bit cleared non-printing characters suppressed

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default mode is UC. Finally, each line supports output logging. The
SET TTOXn LOG command enables logging on a line:

SET TTOXn LOG=filename log output of line n to filename

The SET TTOXn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once TTIX is attached and the simulator is running, the terminals listen
for connections on the specified port. They assume that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET TTIX DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH TTIX command.

Other special commands:

> SHOW TTIX CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW TTIX STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET TTOXn DISCONNECT disconnects the specified line.

The input device (TTIX) implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF\[0:15\] 8 input buffer, lines 0 to 15

DONE 16 device done flags (line 0 rightmost)

ENABLE 16 interrupt enable flag

TIME 24 initial polling interval

The input device is normally polled synchronously with the real-time
clock. To avoid data loss, a poll is scheduled 'TIME' instructions after
the CPU reads a character from any line.

The output device (TTOX) implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF\[0:15\] 8 last data item processed, lines 0-15

DONE 16 device done flag (line 0 rightmost)

ENABLE 16 interrupt enable flag

TIME\[0:16\] 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt,

lines 0-15

The additional terminals do not support save and restore. All open
connections are lost when the simulator shuts down or TTIX is detached.

### TD8E/TU56 DECtape (TD)

The TD8E is a programmed I/O, non-interrupt controller, supporting two
DECtape drives (0 and 1). The TD8E simulator puts a high burden on the
host processor, because tape activity is simulated a line (3b) at a
time. Unless the PDP-8 software requires the TD8E, the TC08 should be
used to simulate DECtapes. The TD8E is disabled by default.

TD8E options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked.

SET TDn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET TDn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The TD8E supports the BOOT
command, but only for unit 0.

The TD8E supports supports PDP-8 format, PDP-11 format, and 18b format
DECtape images. ATTACH assumes the image is in PDP-8 format; the user
can force other choices with switches:

\-s PDP-11 format

\-f 18b format

\-a autoselect based on file on file size

The TD8E controller is a data-only simulator; the timing and mark track,
and block header and trailer, are not stored. Thus, read always produces
standard values for mark track, header, and trailer words, and write
throws mark track, header, and trailer words into the bit bucket.

The TD8E controller implements these registers:

name size comments

TDCMD 4 command register

TDDAT 12 data register

TDMTK 6 mark track register

TDSLF 1 single line flag

TDQLF 1 quad line flag

TDTME 1 timing error flag

TDQL 2 quad line counter

LTIME 31 time between lines

DCTIME 31 time to decelerate to a full stop

POS\[0:1\] 32 position, in lines, units 0 and 1

STATT\[0:1\] 18 unit state, units 0 and 1

STOP\_OFFR 1 stop on off-reel error

The LTIME parameter should not be changed, or OS/8 may fail to run
correctly. The DCTIME parameter should always be at least 100 times
greater than LTIME. Acceleration time is 75% of deceleration time.

### TA8E/TA60 Cassette Tape (CT)

The TA8E is a programmed I/O controller supporting two cassette drives
(0 and 1). The TA8E can be used with the MCPIP program under OS/8, and
with the CAPS-8 operating system. Cassettes are simulated as magnetic
tapes with a fixed capacity (93,000 characters). The tape format is
always SimH standard. The TA8E is disabled by default.

TA8E options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked.

SET CTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET CTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Units cannot be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The TA8E supports the BOOT
command, but only for CAPS-8, and only for unit 0.

The TA8E controller implements these registers:

name size comments

CTSRA 8 status register A

CTSRB 8 status register B

CTDB 8 data buffer

CTDF 1 data flag

RDY 1 ready flag

WLE 1 write lock error

WRITE 1 TA60 write operation flag

INT 1 interrupt request

BPTR 17 buffer pointer

BLNT 17 buffer length

STIME 24 operation start time

CTIME 24 character latency

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O errors flag

POS\[0:1\] 32 position, units 0-1

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready; if STOP\_IOE, stop

end of file bad tape

OS I/O error CRC error; if STOP\_IOE, stop

## Moving Head Disks

### RK8E Cartridge Disk (RK)

RK8E options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked:

SET RKn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET RKn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The RK8E supports the BOOT
command.

The RK8E implements these registers:

name size comments

RKCMD 12 disk command

RKDA 12 disk address

RKMA 12 current memory address

BUSY 1 control busy flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

STIME 24 seek time, per cylinder

RTIME 24 rotational delay

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

end of file x assume rest of disk is zero

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### RL8A Cartridge Disk (RL)

RL8A options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked:

SET RLn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET RLn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The RL8A supports the BOOT
command, but only for unit 0.

INT 1 interrupt request

DONE 1 done flag

ERR 1 composite error flag

STIME 1 seek time, per cylinder

RTIME 1 rotational delay

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

end of file x assume rest of disk is zero

OS I/O error x report error and stop

## RX8E/RX01, RX28/RX02 Floppy Disk (RX)

The RX can be configured as an RX8E with two RX01 drives, or an RX28
with two RX02 drives:

SET RX RX8E set controller to RX8E/RX01

SET RX RX28 set controller to RX28/RX02

The controller is set to the RX8E by default. The RX28 is not
backwards-compatible with the RX8E and will not work with the standard
OS/8 V3D floppy disk driver.

RX8E options include the ability to set units write enabled or write
locked:

SET RXn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET RXn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

RX28 options include, in addition, the ability to set the unit density
to single density, double density, or autosized; autosizing is the
default:

SET RXn SINGLE set unit n single density

SET RXn DOUBLE set unit n double density

SET RXn AUTOSIZE set unit n autosize

The RX8E and RX28 support the BOOT command.

The RX8E and RX28 implement these registers:

name size comments

RXCS 12 status

RXDB 12 data buffer

RXES 12 error status

RXTA 8 current track

RXSA 8 current sector

STAPTR 4 controller state

BUFPTR 8 buffer pointer

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

RX01 and RX02 data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file
and OS I/O errors cannot occur.

## Fixed Head Disks

With default device addressing, either the RF08 or the DF32 can be
present in a configuration, but not both.

### RF08/RS08 Fixed Head Disk (RF)

RF08 options include the ability to set the number of platters to a
fixed value between 1 and 4, or to autosize the number of platters:

SET RF 1P one platter (256K)

SET RF 2P two platters (512K)

SET RF 3P three platters (768K)

SET RF 4P four platters (1024K)

SET RF AUTOSIZE autosized on ATTACH

The default is one platter.

The RF08 implements these registers:

name size comments

STA 12 status

DA 20 current disk address

MA 12 memory address (in memory)

WC 12 word count (in memory)

WLK 32 write lock switches

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

TIME 24 rotational delay, per word

BURST 1 burst flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

The RF08 supports the BOOT command. The default bootstrap is for OS/8.
To bootstrap the 4K Disk Monitor, use the BOOT -D RF command.

The RF08 is a three-cycle data break device. If BURST = 0, word
transfers are scheduled individually; if BURST = 1, the entire transfer
occurs in a single data break.

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

RF08 data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.

### DF32/DS32 Fixed Head Disk (DF)

DF32 options include the ability to set the number of platters to a
fixed value between 1 and 4, or to autosize the number of platters:

SET DF 1P one platter (32K)

SET DF 2P two platters (64K)

SET DF 3P three platters (98K)

SET DF 4P four platters (128K)

SET DF AUTOSIZE autosized on ATTACH

The default is one platter.

The DF32 implements these registers:

name size comments

STA 12 status, disk and memory address extension

DA 12 low order disk address

MA 12 memory address (in memory)

WC 12 word count (in memory)

WLK 16 write lock switches

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

TIME 24 rotational delay, per word

BURST 1 burst flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

The DF32 supports the BOOT command. The default bootstrap is for OS/8.
To bootstrap the 4K Disk Monitor, use the BOOT -D DF command.

The DF32 is a three-cycle data break device. If BURST = 0, word
transfers are scheduled individually; if BURST = 1, the entire transfer
occurs in a single data break.

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

DF32 data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.

##  TC08/TU56 DECtape (DT)

DT implements the TC08 DECtape controller and TU56 drives. TC08 options
include the ability to make units write enabled or write locked.

SET DTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET DTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The TC08 supports the BOOT
command, but only for unit 0.

The TC08 supports supports PDP-8 format, PDP-11 format, and 18b format
DECtape images. ATTACH assumes the image is in PDP-8 format; the user
can force other choices with switches:

\-s PDP-11 format

\-f 18b format

\-a autoselect based on file on file size

The TC08 controller is a data-only simulator; the timing and mark track,
and block header and trailer, are not stored. Thus, the WRITE TIMING AND
MARK TRACK function is not supported; the READ ALL function always
returns the hardware standard block header and trailer; and the WRITE
ALL function dumps non-data words into the bit bucket.

The DECtape controller implements these registers:

name size comments

DTSA 12 status register A

DTSB 12 status register B

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ENB 1 interrupt enable flag

DTF 1 DECtape flag

ERF 1 error flag

CA 12 current address (memory location 7754)

WC 12 word count (memory location 7755)

LTIME 31 time between lines

DCTIME 31 time to decelerate to a full stop

SUBSTATE 2 read/write command substate

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, in lines, units 0 to 7

STATT\[0:7\] 31 unit state, units 0 to 7

STOP\_OFFR 1 stop on off-reel error

It is critically important to maintain certain timing relationships
among the DECtape parameters, or the DECtape simulator will fail to
operate correctly.

  - LTIME must be at least 6

  - DCTIME needs to be at least 100 times LTIME

Acceleration time is set to 75% of deceleration time.

##  TM8E Magnetic Tape (MT)

Magnetic tape options include the ability to make units write enabled or
write locked.

SET MTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET MTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

SET MTn CAPAC=m set unit n capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)

SHOW MTn CAPAC show unit n capacity in MB

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The magnetic tape controller implements these registers:

name size comments

CMD 12 command

FNC 12 function

CA 12 memory address

WC 12 word count

DB 12 data buffer

STA 12 main status

STA2 6 secondary status

DONE 1 device done flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

TIME 24 record delay

UST\[0:7\] 24 unit status, units 0 to 7

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, units 0 to 7

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready; if STOP\_IOE, stop

end of file bad tape

OS I/O error parity error; if STOP\_IOE, stop

# Symbolic Display and Input

The PDP-8 simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

\-a display as ASCII character

\-c display as two packed sixbit characters

\-t display as two packed TSS/8 sixbit characters

\-m display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

' or -a ASCII character

" or -c two packed sixbit characters

\# or -t two packed TSS/8 sixbit characters

alphabetic instruction mnemonic

numeric octal number

Instruction input uses standard PDP-8 assembler syntax. There are four
instruction classes: memory reference, IOT, field change, and operate.

Memory reference instructions have the format

memref {I} {C/Z} address

where I signifies indirect, C a current page reference, and Z a zero
page reference. The address is an octal number in the range 0 - 07777;
if C or Z is specified, the address is a page offset in the range 0 -
177. Normally, C is not needed; the simulator figures out from the
address what mode to use. However, when referencing memory outside the
CPU (eg, disks), there is no valid PC, and C must be used to specify
current page addressing.

IOT instructions consist of single mnemonics, eg, KRB, TLS. IOT
instructions may be or'd together

iot iot iot...

The simulator does not check the legality of the proposed combination.
IOT's for which there is no opcode may be specified as IOT n, where n is
an octal number in the range 0 - 0777.

Field change instructions (CIF, CDF) have the format

fldchg field

where field is an octal number in the range 0 - 7. Field change
instructions may be or'd together.

Operate instructions have the format

opr opr opr...

The simulator does not check the legality of the proposed combination.
EAE mode A and B mnemonics may be specified regardless of the EAE mode.
The operands for MUY and DVI must be deposited explicitly.
