Most devices can be disabled or enabled, by the commands:

SET \<dev\> DISABLED

SET \<dev\> ENABLED

The simulator allows most device numbers to be changed, by the command:

SET \<dev\> DEV=\<number\>

However, devices can only be booted with their default device numbers.

The 18b PDP simulators implement several unique stop conditions:

-   An unimplemented instruction is decoded, and register STOP\_INST is
    set

-   More than XCT\_MAX nested executes are detected during instruction
    execution

-   An FP15 instruction is decoded, the FP15 is disabled, and register
    STOP\_FPP is set

-   A simulated DECtape runs off the end of its reel, and register
    STOP\_OFFR is set

The LOAD command supports three different file formats:

-   PDP-7/9/15 hardware read-in RIM format files (data only loaded into
    sequential addresses)

-   PDP-4/7 \"second stage\" RIM format files (alternating DAC address
    instructions and data)

-   PDP-9/15 binary loader format files

The load file format can be specified by switches:

-   --R: hardware read-in RIM format

-   --S: second stage RIM format

-   --B: binary loader format

If no switch is specified, the load file format is determined from the
file extension. Files ending in .RIM are assumed to be RIM format
(hardware versus second stage is determined from the data); files ending
in any other extension are assumed to be binary loader format. Examples:

LOAD -R file address load PDP-9/PDP-15 RIM format file

starting at address

LOAD -S file load PDP-4/PDP-7 RIM format file

LOAD file.RIM address assume file is RIM, determine type from data

LOAD -B file load PDP-9/PDP-15 BIN format file

LOAD file.BIN assume file is PDP-9/PDP-15 BIN format

If no address is given for a RIM format load, a starting address of 200
(octal) is assumed.

The DUMP command is not supported.

CPU
---

The CPU options are the presence of the EAE, the presence of the API and
memory protection (for the PDP-9 and PDP-15), the presence of relocation
or XVM (PDP-15 only), and the size of main memory.

system option comment

all SET CPU EAE enable EAE

all SET CPU NOEAE disable EAE

9,15 SET CPU API enable API

9,15 SET CPU NOAPI disable API

9,15 SET CPU PROT enable memory protection

15 SET CPU RELOC enable memory relocation

15 SET CPU XVM enable XVM relocation

9,15 SET CPU NOPROT disable protection, relocation, XVM

4 SET CPU 4K set memory size = 4K

all SET CPU 8K set memory size = 8K

all SET CPU 12K set memory size = 12K

all SET CPU 16K set memory size = 16K

all SET CPU 20K set memory size = 20K

all SET CPU 24K set memory size = 24K

all SET CPU 28K set memory size = 28K

all SET CPU 32K set memory size = 32K

15 SET CPU 48K set memory size = 48K

15 SET CPU 64K set memory size = 64K

15 SET CPU 80K set memory size = 80K

15 SET CPU 96K set memory size = 96K

15 SET CPU 112K set memory size = 112K

15 SET CPU 128K set memory size = 128K

Memory sizes greater than 8K are only available on the PDP-7, PDP-9, and
PDP-15; memory sizes greater than 32KW are only available on the PDP-15.
If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 8K for the
PDP-4, 32K for the PDP-7 and PDP-9, and 128K for the PDP-15.

The PROT option corresponds to the KX09A on the PDP-9 and the KM15 for
the PDP-15. The PROT option is required to run the Foreground/Background
Monitor. The RELOC option corresponds to the KT15 on the PDP-15, and the
XVM option corresponds to the XM15 on the PDP-15. ADSS-15, ADSS-15
Foreground/Background, and standard DOS-15 will \<not\> run if these
options are enabled.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

\"addr\" signifies the address width of the system (13b for the PDP-4,
15b for the PDP-7 and PDP-9, 17b for the PDP-15).

The CPU attempts to detect when the simulator is idle. When idle, the
simulator does not use any resources on the host system. Idle detection
is controlled by the SET IDLE and SET NOIDLE commands:

SET CPU IDLE enable idle detection

SET CPU NOIDLE disable idle detection

Idle detection is disabled by default. At present, the CPU is considered
idle if it is executing a KSF/JMP \*-1 loop with interrupts disabled
(DECSYS) or a JMP \* loop (XVM/RSX). There is no idle loop detector for
ADSS, F/B, or DOS.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 65536 entries.

Floating Point Processor (FPP)
------------------------------

The PDP-15 features an optional floating point processor, the FP15
(FPP). The FPP can be enabled and disabled; by default it is disabled.

The FPP implements these registers:

name size comments

FIR 12 floating instruction register

EPA 18 EPA (A exponent)

FMAS 1 FMA sign

FMAH 17 FMA\<1:17\>

FMAL 18 FMA\<18:35\>

EPB 18 EPB (B exponent)

FMBS 1 FMB sign

FMBH 17 FMB\<1:17\>

FMBL 18 FMB\<18:35\>

FGUARD 1 guard bit

FMQH 17 FMQ\<1:17\>

FMQL 18 FMQ\<18:35\>

JEA 18 exception address register

STOP\_FPP 1 stop if FP15 instruction decoded

while FP15 is disabled

Programmed I/O Devices
----------------------

### Paper Tape Reader (PTR)

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader supports the BOOT command. The specific forms
recognized vary from system to system:

system command comments

4,7 BOOT PTR load RIM loader and start it running

4,7 BOOT -F PTR load funny format loader and start it

running

7 BOOT -H PTR start hardware RIM load at address given

by address switches (ASW)

9,15 BOOT {-H} PTR start hardware RIM load at address

given by address switches (ASW)

The PDP-4 does not have a hardware read-in mode load capability.

The ATTACH PTR command recognizes two switches, -A for ASCII mode and
--K for KSR mode. In ASCII mode, data returned by the read alphabetic
command has even parity. This allows normal text files to be used as
input to the paper tape reader on the PDP-9 and PDP-15. In KSR mode,
data returned by the read alphabetic command has forced ones parity.
This allows normal text files to be used as input to the paper tape
reader on the PDP-7.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

ERR 1 error flag (PDP-9, PDP-15 only)

POS 32 position in the input file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

end of file 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The ATTACH PTP command recognizes one switch, -A for ASCII mode. In
ASCII mode, data is punched with the high order bit clear, and NULL and
DEL characters are suppressed. This allows punch output to be processed
with normal text editing utilities.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

ERR 1 error flag (PDP-9, PDP-15 only)

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Terminal Input (TTI)

On the PDP-7, PDP-9, and PDP-15, the terminal interfaces (TTI, TTO) can
be set to one of four modes, KSR, 7P, 7B, or 8B. On the PDP-7 and PDP-9,
"Unix v0" mode is also available:

mode input characters output characters

KSR lower case converted lower case converted to upper case

to upper case, high-order bit cleared,

high-order bit set non-printing characters suppressed

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

UNIX high order bit set no changes

CR, LF interchanged

ESC mapped to ALTMODE

The default mode is KSR.

The console terminal operates, by default, with local echo. The terminal
input can be set to FDX (full duplex), which suppresses local echo.

The terminal input (TTI) polls the console keyboard for input. It
implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUF2ND 5 (PDP-4 only) saved character

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

POS 32 number of characters input

TIME 24 input polling interval (if 0, the keyboard

is polled synchronously with the line clock)

### Terminal Output (TTO)

The terminal output (TTO) writes to the simulator console window. It
implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

SHIFT 5 (PDP-4 only) letters/figures flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

POS 32 number of characters output

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

### Line Printers (LPT, LP9)

The line printers (LPT, LP9) write data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

LPT is the \"default\" line printer for a CPU: Type 62 for the PDP-4,
Type 647 for the PDP-7 and PDP-9, and LP15 for the PDP-15. LP9 is the
LP09 line printer controller for the PDP-9. It may be needed on the
PDP-15 to run certain software packages. LP9 is disabled by default.

The LP15 is a 3-cycle data break device. The current address register is
in memory. It can be examined and modified with SET and SHOW commands:

SHOW LPT CA display current

SET LPT CA=value set current address to value

The Type 62 printer controller implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

SPC 1 spacing done flag

BPTR 6 print buffer pointer

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

LBUF\[0:119\] 8 line buffer

The Type 647 printer controller implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable (PDP-9 only)

ERR 1 error flag

BPTR 7 print buffer pointer

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

LBUF\[0:119\] 8 line buffer

The LP09 printer controller implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 7 output character

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable

ERR 1 error flag

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

The LP15 printer controller implements these registers:

name size comments

STA 18 status register

MA 18 DMA memory address

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ENABLE 1 interrupt enable

LCNT 8 line counter

BPTR 7 print buffer pointer

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

LBUF\[0:131\] 8 line buffer

For all printers, error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape or paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Real-Time Clock (CLK)

The real-time clock (CLK) frequency can be adjusted as follows:

SET CLK 60HZ set frequency to 60Hz

SET CLK 50HZ set frequency to 50Hz

The default is 60Hz.

The clock implements these registers:

name size comments

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

ENABLE 1 clock enable

TIME 24 clock frequency

The real-time clock autocalibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

### Additional Terminals (TTIX, TTOX)

The additional terminals consist of two independent devices, TTIX and
TTOX. The entire set is modeled as a terminal multiplexer, with TTIX as
the master unit. The additional terminals perform input and output
through Telnet sessions connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH
command specifies the port to be used:

ATTACH TTIX \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

The PDP-9 supports 1-4 additional terminals. The PDP-15 supports 1-16
additional terminals. The number of additional terminals can be changed
with the command:

SET TTIX LINES=n set number of lines to n

The default is one additional terminal.

The additional terminals can be set to one of four modes, KSR, 7P, 7B,
or 8B:

mode input characters output characters

KSR lower case converted lower case converted to upper case

to upper case, high-order bit cleared,

high-order bit set non-printing characters suppressed

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default mode is KSR. Finally, each line supports output logging. The
SET TTOXn LOG command enables logging on a line:

SET TTOXn LOG=filename log output of line n to filename

The SET TTOXn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once TTIX is attached and the simulator is running, the terminals listen
for connections on the specified port. They assume that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET TTOXn DISCONNECT
command, or a DETACH TTIX command.

Other special commands:

> SHOW TTIX CONNECTIONS show current connections
>
> SHOW TTIX STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
>
> SET TTOXn DISCONNECT disconnects the specified line.

The input device (TTIX) implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF\[0:3/0:15\] 8 last character received, lines 0 to 3/15

DONE 16 input ready flags, line 0 on right

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

TIME 24 keyboard polling interval

The output device (TTOX) implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF\[0:3/0:15\] 8 last character transmitted, lines 0 to 3/15

DONE 16 output ready flags, line 0 on right

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

TIME\[0:3/0:15\] 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt,

lines 0 to 3/15

RP15/RP02/RP03 Disk Pack (RP)
-----------------------------

RP15 options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked and to select the type of disk drive:

SET RPn RP02 set unit n to be an RP02 (default)

SET RPn RP03 set unit n to be an RP03

SET RPn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET RPn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The RP15 implements these registers:

name size comments

STA 18 status A

STB 18 status B

DA 18 disk address

MA 18 current memory address

WC 18 word count

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

BUSY 1 control busy flag

STIME 24 seek time, per cylinder

RTIME 24 rotational delay

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

end of file x assume rest of disk is zero

OS I/O error x report error and stop

Type 24/RM09 Serial Drum (DRM)
------------------------------

The serial drum (DRM) implements these registers:

name size comments

DA 9 drum address (sector number)

MA 16 current memory address

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

DONE 1 device done flag

ERR 1 error flag

WLK 32 write lock switches

TIME 24 rotational latency, per word

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

Drum data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.

RB09 Fixed Head Disk (RB)
-------------------------

The RB09 was an early fixed-head disk for the PDP-7 and PDP-9. It was
superceded by the RF09/RS09. It is disabled by default.

The RB09 implements these registers:

name size comments

STA 18 status

DA 20 current disk address

WC 16 word count

MA 15 memory address

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

WLK 20 write lock switches for track groups,

10 tracks per group

TIME 24 rotational delay, per word

BURST 1 burst flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

The RB09 is a data break device. If BURST = 0, word transfers are
scheduled individually; if BURST = 1, the entire transfer occurs in a
single data break.

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

RB09 data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.

RF09/RF15/RS09 Fixed Head Disk (RF)
-----------------------------------

RF09/RF15 options include the ability to set the number of platters to a
fixed value between 1 and 8, or to autosize the number of platters from
the attached file:

SET RF 1P one platter (256K)

SET RF 2P two platters (512K)

SET RF 3P three platters (768K)

SET RF 4P four platters (1024K)

SET RF 5P five platters (1280K)

SET RF 6P six platters (1536K)

SET RF 7P seven platters (1792K)

SET RF 8P eight platters (2048K)

SET RF AUTOSIZE autosize on ATTACH

The default is AUTOSIZE.

The RF09/RF15 is a 3-cycle data break device. The word count and current
address registers are in memory. They can be examined and modified with
SET and SHOW commands:

SHOW RF CA(WC) display current address (word count)

SET RF CA(WC)=value set current address (word count) to value

The RF09/RF15 implements these registers:

name size comments

STA 18 status

DA 21 current disk address

BUF 18 data buffer (diagnostic only)

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

WLK\[0:7\] 16 write lock switches for disks 0 to 7

TIME 24 rotational delay, per word

BURST 1 burst flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

The RF09/RF15 is a three-cycle data break device. If BURST = 0, word
transfers are scheduled individually; if BURST = 1, the entire transfer
occurs in a single data break.

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

RF15/RF09 data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and
OS I/O errors cannot occur.

Type 550/555, TC02/TU55, and TC15/TU56 DECtape (DT)
---------------------------------------------------

The PDP-4 and PDP-7 use the Type 550 DECtape, a programmed I/O
controller. The PDP-9 uses the TC02, and the PDP-15 uses the TC15. The
TC02 and TC15 are DMA controllers and programmatically identical. Except
for the first five units of the Type 550, PDP-4/7/9/15 DECtape format
has 5 18b words in the block header and trailer, like all other
DECtapes.

In the 550/555, DECtapes drives are numbered 1-8; in the simulator,
drive 8 is unit 0. In the TX02/TC15, DECtape drives are numbered 0-7.
DECtape options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked.

SET DTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

SET DTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The Type 550, TC02, and TC15 support PDP-8 format, PDP-11 format, and
18b format DECtape images. . ATTACH assumes the image is in 18b format;
the user can force other choices with switches:

-t PDP-8 format

-s PDP-11 format

-a autoselect based on file size

The DECtape controller is a data-only simulator; the timing and mark
track, and block header and trailer, are not stored. Thus, the WRITE
TIMING AND MARK TRACK function is not supported; the READ ALL function
always returns the hardware standard block header and trailer; and the
WRITE ALL function dumps non-data words into the bit bucket.

The TC02 and TC15 are 3-cycle databreak devices. The word count and
current address registers are in memory. They can be examined and
modified with SET and SHOW commands:

SHOW DT CA(WC) display current address (word count)

SET DT CA(WC)=value set current address (word count) to value

The DECtape controller implements these registers:

system name size comments

all DTSA 12 status register A

all DTSB 12 status register B

all DTDB 18 data buffer

all INT 1 interrupt pending flag

9,15 ENB 1 interrupt enable flag

all DTF 1 DECtape flag

7 BEF 1 block end flag

all ERF 1 error flag

all LTIME 31 time between lines

all DCTIME 31 time to decelerate to a full stop

all SUBSTATE 2 read/write command substate

all POS\[0:7\] 32 position, in lines, units 0 to 7

all STATT\[0:7\] 18 unit state, units 0 to 7

all STOP\_OFFR 1 stop on off-reel error

It is critically important to maintain certain timing relationships
among the DECtape parameters, or the DECtape simulator will fail to
operate correctly.

-   LTIME must be at least 6

-   DCTIME needs to be at least 100 times LTIME

Acceleration time is set to 75% of deceleration time.

TC59/TU10 Magnetic Tape (MT)
----------------------------

Magnetic tape options include the ability to make units write enabled or
or write locked.

SET MTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET MTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

SET MTn CAPAC=m set unit n capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)

SHOW MTn CAPAC show unit n capacity in MB

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The TC59 is a 3-cycle data break device. The word count and current
address registers are in memory. They can be examined and modified with
SET and SHOW commands:

SHOW MT CA(WC) display current address (word count)

SET MT CA(WC)=value set current address (word count) to value

The magnetic tape controller implements these registers:

name size comments

CMD 18 command

STA 18 main status

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

TIME 24 record delay

UST\[0:7\] 24 unit status, units 0 to 7

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, units 0 to 7

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready; if STOP\_IOE, stop

end of file bad tape

OS I/O error parity error; if STOP\_IOE, stop

DR15C Parallel Interface (PDP-15/76 only)
-----------------------------------------

The DR15C is a parallel interface that provides the PDP-15 side of the
UC15 control interface in a PDP-15/76 system. It is disabled by default.
Enabling the DR creates the shared memory and status interfaces for
communicating with the UC15.

The DR15C implements these registers:

name size comments

TCBP 18 TCBP pointer

TCBACK 1 TCBP write acknowledge

IE 1 interrupt enable

REQ 4 API requests on levels 3..0

API0..3 1 interrupt request, API levels 0..3

APIVEC0..3 7 API vectors, API levels 0..3

POLL 8 polling interval for shared state changes

Usage of the DR15C is covered in a separate document on running a
PDP-15/76 configuration.

Symbolic Display and Input
==========================

The 18b PDP simulators implement symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

-a display as ASCII character

-b display as three DECsys Baudot packed characters

-c display as three SIXBIT packed characters

-f display as three FIODEC packed character

-m display instruction mnemonics

The PDP-7 and PDP-9 recognize one additional switch:

-u display as Unix v0 ASCII (two 7b ASCII characters

in 9b bytes, big-endian)

The PDP-15 recognizes two additional switches:

-u display as PDP11 ASCII (two 7b ASCII characters

in 8b bytes, little-endian); 16b devices only

-p display as packed ASCII (five 7b ASCII characters

> in two 18b words)

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

\' or -a ASCII character

\" or -c three packed SIXBIT characters

alphabetic instruction mnemonic

numeric octal number

The PDP-7 and PDP-9 recognize one additional input mode:

-u Unix v0 ASCII (two 7b ASCII characters in 9b bytes)

The PDP-15 also recognizes an additional input mode:

-p five character packed ASCII string in two 18b words

-u PDP11 ASCII (two 7b ASCII in 8b bytes, little-endian)

Instruction input uses standard 18b PDP assembler syntax. There are
eight instruction classes: memory reference, EAE, index (PDP-15 only),
IOT, operate, LAW, FP15 memory reference (PDP-15 only), and FP15 no
operand (PDP-15 only).

Memory reference instructions have the format

PDP-4, PDP-7: memref {I} address

PDP-9: memref{\*} address

PDP-15: memref{\*} address{,X}

where I (PDP-4, PDP-7) /\* (PDP-9, PDP-15) signifies indirect reference,
and X signifies indexing (PDP-15 in page mode only). The address is an
octal number in the range 0 - 017777 (PDP-4, PDP-7, PDP-9, and PDP-15 in
bank mode) or 0 - 07777 (PDP-15 in page mode).

IOT instructions consist of single mnemonics, eg, KRB, TLS. IOT
instructions may be or\'d together

iot iot iot\...

IOT\'s may also include the number 10, signifying clear the accumulator

iot 10

The simulator does not check the legality of IOT combinations. IOT\'s
for which there is no opcode may be specified as IOT n, where n is an
octal number in the range 0 - 07777.

EAE instructions have the format

eae {+/- shift count}

EAE instructions may be or\'d together

eae eae eae\...

The simulator does not check the legality of EAE combinations. EAE\'s
for which there is no opcode may be specified as EAE n, where n is an
octal number in the range 0 - 037777.

Index instructions (PDP-15 only) have the format

index {immediate}

The immediate, if allowed, must be in the range of -0400 to +0377.

Operate instructions have the format

opr opr opr\...

The simulator does not check the legality of the proposed combination.
The operands for MUY and DVI must be deposited explicitly.

The LAW instruction has the format

LAW immediate

where immediate is in the range of 0 to 017777.

FP15 memory reference instructions occupy two successive words and have
the format

fpmem{\*} address

where \* signifies indirect addressing. The address is a number in the
range 0 - 0377777.

FP15 no operand instructions occupy two successive words and have the
format

fpop

The second word is ignored on output and set to 0 on input.

Character Sets
==============

The PDP-4\'s console was an ASR-28 Teletype; its character encoding was
Baudot. The PDP-4\'s line printer used a modified Hollerith character
set. The PDP-7\'s and PDP-9\'s consoles were KSR-33 Teletypes; their
character sets were basically ASCII. The PDP-7\'s and PDP-9\'s line
printers used sixbit encoding (ASCII codes 040 - 0137 masked to six
bits). The PDP-15\'s I/O devices were all ASCII. The following table
provides equivalences between ASCII characters and the PDP-4\'s I/O
devices. In the console table, FG stands for figures (upper case).

DECsys Baudot packs the five bit character code, and the figure/letters
flag, into six bits as follows:

bits\<0:4\> Baudot 5b character code

bit\<5\> 0 = letters, 1 = figures
