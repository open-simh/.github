Introduction
============

This manual documents the features and operation of the HP 2100
simulator. It is intended for use in conjunction with the *SIMH Users\'
Guide* manual, which describes how to compile and run the simulator, as
well as the general commands that may be entered at the Simulation
Control Program (SCP) prompt.

The HP 21xx/1000 Computer Systems
---------------------------------

Hewlett-Packard sold the HP 21xx/1000 family of real-time computers from
1966 through 2000. There are three major divisions within this family:
the 21xx core-memory machines, the 1000 (originally 21MX) M/E/F-Series
semiconductor-memory machines, and the 1000 L/A-Series distributed-I/O
machines. All machines are 16-bit accumulator-oriented CISC machines
running the same base instruction set. A wide range of operating systems
run on these machines, from a simple 4K word paper-tape-based monitor to
a megaword multi-user, multiprogramming disc-based system and a
multi-user time-shared BASIC system.

Within each division, several distinct models were produced:

-   the HP 2116; introduced in 1966, expandable to 32 K words
    > (originally 16 K words).

-   the HP 2115 (1967); slower, more I/O-limited, expandable to 8 K
    > words.

-   the HP 2114 (1968); low-cost, still-more-limited expandability,
    > expandable to 8 K words.

-   the HP 2100 (1971); user-microprogrammable, optional floating-point
    > instructions, expandable to 32 KW.

-   the HP 21MX (1974, renamed 1000 M); memory-mapped, larger
    > instruction set, expandable to 1024 KW.

-   the HP 21MXE (1976, renamed 1000 E); faster CPU and memory, larger
    > microprogram address space.

-   the HP 1000 F-Series (1979); an E-Series CPU with a separate
    > hardware floating-point processor.

-   the HP 1000 L-Series (1979); low-cost, slower, distributed I/O
    > system, limited to 32K words.

-   the HP 1000 XL-Series (1980); an L-Series CPU with memory mapping,
    > expandable to 256 KW.

-   the HP 1000 A600 (1982); E-Series speed with L-Series distributed
    > I/O, expandable to 2048 KW.

-   the HP 1000 A700 (1982); an A600 with an optional hardware
    > floating-point processor.

-   the HP 1000 A900 (1983); faster pipelined processor, cache memory,
    > expandable to 3072 KW.

-   the HP 1000 A400 (1986); lower-cost, limited I/O expandability,
    > expandable to 2048 KW.

-   the HP 1000 A990 (1991); fastest and last 1000 made, expandable to
    > 4096 KW.

HP claimed the relative CPU performance, normalized to a 1000 E-Series,
as follows:

  ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------
  ***2114***   ***2115***   ***2116***   ***2100***   ***1000 M***   ***1000 E***   ***1000 F***   ***1000 L***   ***A400***   ***A600***   ***A700***   ***A900***   ***A990***
  0.22         0.37         0.42         0.55         0.45           1.0            1.4            0.3            1.1          1.0          1.67         3.3          6.7
  ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------

All of the machines support a 15-bit logical address space, addressing a
maximum of 32K words, divided into 1K-word pages. Memory-referencing
instructions in the base set can directly address the 1024 words of the
base page (page 0) or the 1024 words of the current page (the page
containing the instruction). The instructions in the extended set
directly address the 32768 words in the full logical address space. The
A and B accumulators may be addressed as logical addresses 0 and 1,
respectively.

Peripheral devices are connected to the CPU by interface cards installed
in the I/O card cages present in the CPU and optional I/O extender
chassis. Each slot in the card cage is assigned an address, called a
*select code*, that may be referenced by I/O instructions in the base
set. Select codes range from 0 to 77 octal, with the first eight select
codes reserved for the system, providing connections for 56 possible
interfaces.

The 211x machines use a hardwired processor providing 70 basic
instructions and up to 32K of core memory. The base instruction set is
divided into the Memory Reference Group, the Shift-Rotate Group, the
Alter-Skip Group, and the I/O Group. SRG instruction words may contain
from one to four suboperation codes that are executed from
left-to-right, and ASG instruction words may contain from one to eight
suboperations. An optional Extended Arithmetic Unit may be added to the
2115 and 2116 that provides hardware multiply and divide, double-load
and -store, and double-word shift and rotate instructions.

The 2100 machine uses a microprogrammed processor that provides the 80
instructions of the base set and the EAU as standard equipment. Optional
floating-point microcode adds six two-word single-precision
instructions. User microprogramming is also supported. When used as part
of an HP 2000 Time-Shared BASIC system, the CPU designated as the I/O
processor may be equipped with microcode implementing 18 additional OS
accelerator instructions.

The 1000 M/E-Series machines also use microprogrammed processors and
extend the 2100 instruction set with two new index registers, X and Y,
and a new Extended Instruction Group consisting of 32 index-register
instructions and 10 word-and-byte-manipulation instructions. The six
2100 floating-point instructions are also standard. The 1000 F-Series
adds a hardware floating-point processor with 18 new triple- and
quad-word instructions. A number of new optional microcode extensions
are available with the M/E/F-Series.

The 21xx and 1000 machines provide Direct Memory Access and Dual-Channel
Port Controller options, respectively, for high-speed I/O transfers. The
2114 supports a single DMA channel; all other machines support two DMA
or DCPC channels.

1000 CPUs offer the optional Dynamic Mapping System, which provides
memory mapping on a page-by-page basis. The 5-bit page number of a
logical memory address selects one of 32 ten-bit map registers
containing physical page numbers. The ten-bit page number combined with
the ten-bit page offset yields a 20-bit physical address capable of
accessing a location in a one-megaword memory. DMS provides separate
maps for system and user programs, as well as for the two DCPC channels,
and includes microcode that implements the 38 Dynamic Mapping
Instructions used to manipulate the mapping system.

Optional memory protection is accomplished by dividing the logical
address space into protected and unprotected parts. When protection is
enabled, any attempt to write below the fence separating the two parts
is inhibited, and an interrupt to the operating system occurs, which
aborts the offending user program. If the DMS option is enabled as well,
protection is enhanced by specifying read and write permissions on a
page-by-page basis.

This implementation is a simulator for the HP 21xx and 1000 M/E/F-Series
machines (hereafter referred collectively as the HP computer family
unless a specific machine reference is required). A large variety of CPU
options, device interface cards, and peripherals are provided.

This simulator does not model the 1000 L/A-Series machines. While these
machines use the same base instruction set, the I/O structure is
entirely different, and the interfaces are not interchangeable with
those of the 21xx/1000 machines. Moreover, the peripherals provided by
this simulator are, with few exceptions, not supported on the
L/A-Series. An L/A-Series implementation would be almost a completely
new simulator and therefore likely would be best constructed as a
separate project.

Simulator Files
---------------

The simulator sources are divided into a set of files for the Simulator
Control Program and its support libraries, and a set of files for the HP
21xx/1000 CPU and device simulations; the latter reside in a
subdirectory of the directory that contains the SCP files. The former
set is common to all SIMH simulators, whereas the latter set is specific
to the virtual machine being simulated. The files that make up this
simulator are:

One instance of each listed device may be installed in the simulated
computer chassis. Many devices support multiple connected units. As an
example, the DS device simulates a single 13175D Disc Controller
Interface that connects up to eight drives. However, installing a second
13175D to connect an additional eight drives is not supported.

The simulator has been tested with and supports the following operating
systems:

-   2000E Time-Shared BASIC revision 1534.

-   2000F Time-Shared BASIC revision 1410.

-   2000 Access Time-Shared BASIC revision 1812.

-   DOS Disc Operating System revision C.

-   DOS-M Disc Operating System revision F.

-   DOS-III Disc Operating System revision 1511.

-   RTE-II Real-Time Executive revision 1926.

-   RTE-III Real-Time Executive revision 1926.

-   RTE-IV Real-Time Executive revision 2013.

-   RTE-IVB Real-Time Executive revision 5010.

-   RTE-6/VM Real-Time Executive revision 6210.

In addition, the simulator generally passes the HP 24396 Stand-Alone
Diagnostics suite; see *hp2100\_diag.txt* for details.

The simulator may be configured to stop for any of these conditions:

-   Attempted execution of an unimplemented or undefined instruction.

-   Attempted execution of an I/O instruction that addresses an
    > unassigned select code.

-   Attempted execution of a memory reference instruction with too many
    > indirect references.

-   Occurrence of an I/O error on a device that does not report error
    > status to the CPU.

The simulator also provides extensive facilities for tracing CPU and I/O
device operations.

Hardware-Equivalent Actions
---------------------------

The current implementation does not provide simulations of the CPU or
peripheral device front panels. Instead, commands entered through the
simulation console are used to perform hardware actions. The simulation
commands that substitute for CPU front-panel actions are:

  ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  ***Hardware Front-Panel Action***           ***Equivalent Simulation Command***
  Pressing the RUN button                     GO
  Pressing the HALT button                    CTRL+E
  Pressing the INSTR STEP button              STEP
  Pressing the PRESET button                  RESET
  Pressing the PRESET and RUN buttons         RUN
  Pressing the IBL button                     LOAD CPU
  Pressing the IBL, PRESET, and RUN buttons   BOOT CPU
  Pressing the LOADER ENABLE button           SET CPU LOADERENABLE
  Displaying memory                           EXAMINE \<address\>
  Displaying registers                        EXAMINE \<register\>
  Setting memory                              DEPOSIT \<address\> \<value\>
  Setting registers                           DEPOSIT \<register\> \<value\>
  Setting the switch register                 DEPOSIT S \<value\>
  ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------

Memory may also be displayed, but not set, by setting the M (memory
address) register to the desired memory address and displaying the T
(memory data) register.

Mounting media on a peripheral device is simulated by the ***ATTACH***
command. For example, entering the ***ATTACH PTR
\<tape-image-filename\>*** command is equivalent to loading the paper
tape into an HP 2748B Tape Reader. Inserting a disc pack into an HP
7900A disc drive set for unit 2 is simulated by the ***ATTACH DPC2
\<disc-image-filename\>*** command.

Each of these commands is explained in more detail below.

In hardware, loading programs into memory from a device is accomplished
by running a bootstrap loader that is configured for the select code(s)
used by the device interface. For the 2114, 2115, 2116, and 2100 CPUs,
this involves enabling the protected area of core memory containing the
loader, setting the P register to point at the loader's starting
address, and pressing PRESET (or INTERNAL PRESET and EXTERNAL PRESET for
the 2100) and RUN. For the 1000 M/E/F-Series CPUs, loading involves
setting the S register to select the bootstrap loader ROM and interface
select code, and pressing STORE, IBL, PRESET, and RUN.

In simulation, bootstrap loaders may be loaded and run explicitly or
implicitly. Explicit operation is described in the Bootstrap Loaders
section of the CPU device description below. As a convenience, ***BOOT
\<device\>*** commands may be used to implicitly bootstrap their
respective devices and are described in the individual device
descriptions below.

Simulator-Specific Commands
---------------------------

In general, all of the commands documented in the *SIMH Users\' Guide*
manual are available for use with the HP 2100 simulator. Commands whose
execution or parameters are implementation-defined are specified below.

### Numeric Display and Entry

When examining or depositing into memory, the radix for addresses is
octal, and the default radix for numeric data is octal. The data default
may be changed with the ***SET CPU { BIN \| OCT \| DEC \| HEX }***
command, or the radix may be overridden temporarily with a command line
switch, as follows:

  --------------------- ----------------------
  ***Switch***          ***Interpretation***
  **--2**               A binary value
  **--8** or **--O**    An octal value
  **--10** or **--D**   A decimal value
  **--16** or **--H**   A hexadecimal value
  --------------------- ----------------------

When examining or depositing into device registers, the default radix
for the specified register is used unless overridden with one of the
above command line switches. Defaults are listed in the register table
associated with each device.

### Symbolic Display and Entry

When examining or depositing into memory or certain registers, command
line switches specifying the symbolic mode and format may be used to
override the default numeric mode, as follows:

  -------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Switch***   ***Mode Interpretation***
  **--A**        A single character in the right-hand byte
  **--C**        A two-character packed string
  **--M**        A CPU instruction mnemonic
  -------------- -------------------------------------------

In the absence of a mode switch or a specified symbolic default,
entering values with a leading \' (apostrophe) implies ***--A***, a
leading \" (quotation mark) implies ***--C***, and a leading alphabetic
or punctuation character implies ***--M***. The specific registers
supporting symbolic mode are indicated in their respective device
sections below.

If the ***--C*** switch is specified, the value is displayed as two
characters separated by a comma. Alphanumeric, punctuation, and symbol
characters are displayed within apostrophes, control characters are
displayed as ASCII name abbreviations, and characters above 128 decimal
are displayed in escaped numeric form with a leading backslash followed
by an octal number. Depositing with ***--C*** accepts two displayable
characters. If a single character is supplied, the low byte of the
resulting value will be zero; follow the character with a space to pad
the low byte with a blank.

If the ***--M*** switch is specified, the value is displayed or accepted
as a CPU machine instruction mnemonic if it is defined and implemented
in the currently enabled firmware set. If it is not, it is displayed as
a numeric value in the CPU\'s data radix or is rejected if depositing.
Any numeric operands present are displayed or accepted in a default
radix unless overridden by the addition of one of these mutually
exclusive format switches:

  -------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Switch***   ***Format Interpretation***
  **--A**        A single character in the right-hand byte
  **--B**        A binary value
  **--O**        An octal value
  **--D**        A decimal value
  **--H**        A hexadecimal value
  -------------- -------------------------------------------

Operand values use a default radix suitable to the type of the value, as
follows:

-   Operand memory addresses and I/O instruction select codes use the
    > CPU's address radix, which is octal.

-   Extended Arithmetic Unit instruction shift and rotate counts and I/O
    > Processor instruction index displacements use decimal unless
    > overridden by a format switch on the command line.

-   I/O Processor and Scientific Instruction Set instruction operand
    > data values use the CPU\'s data radix, which defaults to octal but
    > may be set to a different radix or overridden by a format switch
    > on the command line.

If the CPU data radix is set to hexadecimal, caution must be exercised
when entering hex values without a leading digit. A value that is the
same as an instruction mnemonic will be interpreted as the latter. For
example, ***CCE*** is an instruction mnemonic, but ***CCEE*** is a hex
value. To avoid confusion, always enter hex values with the ***--H***
switch or with a leading zero (i.e., ***0CCE***).

Machine instruction entry uses the HP Assembler syntax, with the
exceptions noted below. The set of recognized mnemonics depends on the
current machine configuration. Instructions not implemented by the
current CPU model and installed firmware extensions are displayed in
octal form and rejected during symbolic entry.

Operands must be numeric and are interpreted by default in a radix
suitable to the type of the value, rather than the HP Assembler
convention of assuming a decimal value unless the letter B, indicating
an octal value, follows the digits. For example, LDA 1000 loads from
memory location 1000 octal, LIA 12 loads from select code 12 octal, and
RRR 12 rotates the registers right by 12 decimal places.

Memory Reference Group instructions use this extended syntax:

\<opcode\> {C \| Z} \<address\>{,I}

\...where the optional ***C*** or ***Z*** specifies a current-page or a
zero-page (base-page) address, and the optional ***I*** specifies
indirect addressing. If ***C*** or ***Z*** is specified, the address is
restricted to the octal range 0-1777; otherwise, the full 32K logical
addressing range 0-77777 is allowed.

Memory Reference Group machine instructions address locations in either
the 1024-word base page (page 0) or the 1024-word current page (the page
containing the instruction). Normally, the base/current selection and
page offset are implied by the address given: an address from 0-1777 is
a base-page reference, an address within the page containing the
deposited instruction is a current-page reference, and any other address
is illegal. For example, entering ***DEPOSIT 11000 LDA 10000*** stores a
current-page reference with an offset of 0. Entering ***DEPOSIT 11000
LDA 1000*** stores a base-page reference with an offset of 1000.
Entering ***DEPOSIT 11000 LDA 12000*** is rejected as illegal, as the
address is neither within the current page nor the base page.

***C*** or ***Z*** must be specified when the instruction is being
entered into memory above the 32K logical address space or into a device
(e.g., disc) buffer. In these cases, the eventual containing address is
unknown, making the implied current/base page determination impossible.
Therefore, the current/zero indicator and the page offset must be
entered explicitly.

### EXAMINE, DEPOSIT, IEXAMINE, and IDEPOSIT

For these commands, the following address forms are valid:

-   \<page\>.\<offset\>

-   \<logical-address\>

\...where ***page*** is a 10-bit physical page number and ***offset***
is a 10-bit offset within the page (e.g., ***1777.1777***), and
***logical-address*** is a 15-bit offset within the 32K logical address
space (e.g., ***77777***). Command line switches modify the mapping of
logical addresses to physical addresses as follows:

  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  ***Switch***   ***Interpretation***
  **--N**        Use the address directly with no mapping
  **--S**        If memory expansion is enabled, use the system map
  **--U**        If memory expansion is enabled, use the user map
  **--P**        If memory expansion is enabled, use the port A map
  **--Q**        If memory expansion is enabled, use the port B map
  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------

If no switch is specified, the address is interpreted using **--N** if
memory expansion is currently disabled, otherwise it is interpreted
using **--S** if the system map or **--U** if the user map is currently
enabled. If mapping is requested, then memory expansion must be enabled,
and the address must lie within the 32K logical address space.

Addresses within the first 32K are displayed in logical form. Addresses
above 32K are displayed in physical form.

### BREAK and NOBREAK

The ***BREAK*** and ***NOBREAK*** commands accept only logical addresses
consisting of 15-bit offsets within the 32K logical address space (e.g.,
***77777***). If the breakpoint address is not supplied, it defaults to
the current P-register value. Breakpoint addresses are always displayed
in logical form.

The CPU implements four different kinds of instruction breakpoints, as
follows:

  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  ***Switch***   ***Action***
  **--E**        Break unconditionally
  **--N**        Break if memory expansion is disabled
  **--S**        Break if memory expansion and the system map are enabled
  **--U**        Break if memory expansion and the user map are enabled
  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

If no switch is specified, the default is to use **--N** if memory
expansion is currently disabled, otherwise to use **--S** if the system
map or **--U** if the user map is currently enabled. In a DMS
environment, breakpoints on interrupt trap cells should specify the
**--S** switch, as the system map will be enabled when the instruction
is executed.

### RESET

The ***RESET*** command is equivalent in hardware to pressing the PRESET
front-panel button on the 211x and 1000 M/E/F-Series machines, and the
INTERNAL PRESET and EXTERNAL PRESET buttons on the 2100. It presets all
of the installed I/O interfaces. The ***RESET --P*** command is
equivalent to cycling power on the CPU chassis and all installed
peripheral devices. The ***RESET \<device\>*** and ***RESET --P
\<device\>*** commands have no direct hardware analogs. They are
functionally equivalent to presetting or power-cycling just the
specified device and its associated interface card.

### RUN and GO

The ***RUN*** and ***GO*** commands accept only logical addresses
consisting of 15-bit offsets within the 32K logical address space (e.g.,
***77777***). If the starting address is supplied, it is stored in the P
register before execution begins. Otherwise, execution begins at the
current P-register location.

The ***RUN*** command does an implied ***RESET***, so it is equivalent
in hardware to pressing the front-panel PRESET and RUN buttons on the
CPU. As PRESET initializes all of the I/O interfaces, the ***RUN***
command is almost never the proper command to use after a program has
been started. The ***GO*** command is equivalent to pressing the RUN
button on the CPU and is the usual way of resuming execution after a
programmed halt. If a PRESET is required before resuming, the
***RESET*** and ***GO*** commands are direct analogs of pressing the
PRESET and RUN buttons, respectively.

### LOAD, DUMP, and BOOT

The ***LOAD*** command is used to install a bootstrap loader into the
last 64 words of available memory within the 32K logical address space.
The command accepts two forms. The syntax of the first form is:

LOAD \<device-name\>

This command copies the loader associated with the specified bootable
device into memory, configures the loader to the select code(s)
currently used by the device interface, and sets the P register to the
starting address of the loader program. For a given device, the loader
selected depends on the current CPU model, as shown in the following
table:

  ------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- -----------------------------------

  **CPU**             ---                       (various)                 Selected by S-register bits 15-14
  ------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- -----------------------------------

The BMDL (Basic Moving-Head Disc Loader), BBDL (Basic Binary Disc
Loader), BMTL (Basic Magnetic Tape Loader), and the BBL-IOP (Basic
Binary Loader for the I/O Processor) are dual-purpose loaders. In
addition to the specified device, they also permit booting from the
paper tape reader by manually starting the loader from an alternate
address. When one of these loaders is specified, the paper-tape portion
is configured to use the select code of the paper tape reader interface.
The BBL (Basic Binary Loader) and all of the 12992 boot loader ROMs for
the 1000 are single-purpose loaders.

For 1000 systems, the ***LOAD CPU*** command is equivalent to pressing
the front-panel IBL (Initial Binary Loader) button. This copies the
content of one of four installed boot loader ROMs into memory. The ROM
is selected by setting bits 15-14 of the S register to the desired ROM
socket number before issuing the command. The IBL operation is described
in the Bootstrap Loaders section of the CPU device description below.

The DA and CPU devices are not supported on 21xx CPUs, and the DRC
device is not supported on 1000 CPUs. Consequently, there are no loaders
for these device/CPU combinations, and a corresponding ***LOAD***
command will be rejected with a **Command not allowed** error.

The second command form installs a loader from an absolute binary file.
The syntax is:

LOAD \<image-filename\> {\<select-code\>}

The file is read into the last 64 words of memory. If the optional
select code is supplied, the loader I/O instructions are configured to
the specified device; otherwise, the loader is not modified.

The binary file must be targeted to addresses in the octal range
x7700-x7777, where *x* may be 0-7. The loaded program will be relocated
to the last 64 words of available memory, so the desired memory size
must be set before issuing the ***LOAD*** command. If the optional
configuration select code is supplied, all I/O instructions in the
program that reference select codes \>= 10 octal will be changed by
adding the supplied value minus 10 to the instruction. The effect of
this is that instructions that reference select code *10 + n* will be
changed to reference the supplied *select code + n*. This permits the
configuration of loaders using two-card interfaces that reference select
codes 10 and 11.

For 1000-series CPUs, the ***LOAD*** command serves to install boot
loader ROM images other than the ones included with the device
simulators. If the CPU is configured with more than 32K of memory, the
loader is installed in the last 64 words of the 32K logical address
space.

For either ***LOAD*** command form, if the CPU is configured as a 2114,
2115, 2116, or 2100, then the loader remains unprotected when the
command completes to permit subsequent execution. The loader should be
protected with a ***SET CPU LOADERDISABLE*** command if it will not be
used immediately.

The ***DUMP*** command writes the bootstrap loader currently residing in
memory to an absolute binary file. The command format is:

DUMP \<image-filename\>

For 21xx CPUs, the loader must be unprotected with a ***SET CPU
LOADERENABLE*** command before entering the ***DUMP*** command; if the
loader is protected, the output file will contain all zeros. When the
command completes, the loader remains unprotected. The resulting file
may be used in a subsequent ***LOAD*** command to reload the bootstrap
program.

The ***BOOT*** command is equivalent to a sequence of ***LOAD***,
***RESET***, and ***RUN*** commands. The same list of bootable devices
accepted by the ***LOAD*** command above may be used with the ***BOOT***
command. Entering a ***BOOT*** command for one of these devices will
preset the S register to the appropriate value before loading and
executing the applicable binary loader. The bootstrap loaders support
booting only from unit 0 of the target device.

### Device Configuration

Most devices support user configuration. The general forms of the
configuration commands are:

SET {\<switch\> \...} \<device\> \<option\>{,\<option\> \...}\
SET {\<switch\> \...} \<unit\> \<option\>{,\<option\> \...}

The options available and applicable switches are described in the
individual device descriptions below.

### Enabling and Disabling Devices

All devices other than the CPU may be disabled or enabled. Disabling a
device simulates removing the associated accessory or interface from the
system chassis. To disable or enable a device, use:

  ----------------------------- --------------------
  ***Command***                 ***Action***
  **SET \<device\> DISABLED**   Disable the device
  **SET \<device\> ENABLED**    Enable the device
  ----------------------------- --------------------

For devices that use two interface cards, enabling or disabling either
card also enables or disables the other card. For example, entering
***SET DPC DISABLED*** to disable the DPC interface also disables the
DPD interface.

Devices that consist of multiple addressable units connected to a
controller allow the units to be individually disabled or enabled.
Disabling simulates disconnecting the associated unit from the
controller. The commands to disable or enable a unit are:

  --------------------------- ------------------
  ***Command***               ***Action***
  **SET \<unit\> DISABLED**   Disable the unit
  **SET \<unit\> ENABLED**    Enable the unit
  --------------------------- ------------------

Each of the above command options is replicated in the option tables of
the devices to which they apply.

### I/O Interface Select Code Assignments

HP hardware I/O interfaces receive their select code assignments from
the CPU backplane slots into which they are plugged. The first I/O slot
corresponds to select code 10 octal and has the highest interrupt
priority, with priority decreasing with increasing select code number.
Empty slots may not exist between interface cards; if all interfaces are
not in contiguous slots, HP 12777A Priority Jumper Cards must be
installed in the unused slots.

A device's select code may be set with the ***SET \<dev\> SC=\<n\>***
command. The valid range of select code values is 10-77 octal. The
current select code assignment for a device may be displayed with the
***SHOW \<dev\> SC*** command. For example:

SET MSC SC=26\
SHOW PTR SC

The current select codes of all devices are displayed with the ***SHOW
DEVICES*** command. The default settings are:

  ------------------- ------------------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ---------------
  ***Device Name***   ***Select Code***   ***Initially\   ***Device Name***   ***Select Code***   ***Initially\
                                          Disabled***                                             Disabled***

  **DPD**             22                                  **MUX**             40                  

  **DPC**             23                                  **MUXL**            41                  

  **DQD**             24                                  **MUXC**            42                  

  **DQC**             25                                  **DA**              43                  

  **DRD**             26                                  **MC1**             45                  

  **DRC**             27                                  **MC2**             46                  
  ------------------- ------------------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ---------------

For devices with two interface cards (e.g., DP), specify the lower
select code with either device name; the higher select code will be set
automatically, and the cards will be assigned in the correct order. If a
select code conflict occurs, the simulator will report the error when
program execution is attempted. In simulation, empty slots behave as
though they contain HP 12777A Priority Jumper Cards, so the device
assignments need not be contiguous.

Because they are used infrequently, the LPS, MTD and MTC, IPLI and IPLO,
and MC1 and MC2 devices are initially disabled.

The select codes of the CPU, MP, and DMA/DCPC devices are fixed and
cannot be changed or displayed. The MEM device does not have a select
code, as DMS instructions, and not I/O instructions, are used to control
it.

### SAVE and RESTORE

***SAVE*** and ***RESTORE*** are supported only when the simulator
executable used to restore the simulator state file is the same
simulator executable used to save the file. Correctly restoring the
state of the simulator depends on the layout of internal structure
variables being identical to the layout of the structure variables that
were saved. This is guaranteed only when using the same executable, as
the layout used is implementation-defined.

Realistic, Calibrated, and Optimized Timing
-------------------------------------------

Devices simulate their I/O operation delays (disc seeks, magnetic tape
reads, printer paper movements, etc.) by counting specified numbers of
"event ticks." For example, a disc seek completion might be scheduled to
occur 500 event ticks after command initiation. Generally, one event
tick is counted for each machine instruction executed, although some
complex instructions may count an event tick for each internal step of
the instruction (e.g., for each word moved within a block-move
instruction). Device simulations provide commands that determine how the
appropriate tick counts are selected for I/O operations timing:

  ------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  ***Command***                   ***Action***
  ***SET \<device\> REALTIME***   Configure the device to use realistic timing
  ***SET \<device\> CALTIME***    Configure the device to use calibrated timing
  ***SET \<device\> FASTTIME***   Configure the device to use optimized timing
  ------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------

A device configured to use *realistic timing* selects its tick counts to
encompass the same number of machine instructions as would be executed
in hardware. In real-time mode, an operation taking ten milliseconds in
hardware will complete after 15772 machine instructions have executed,
based on an average 1000 E-Series hardware instruction execution time of
0.634 microseconds. In this mode, a software program will execute
approximately the same number of instructions during a device operation
that it would do on a real machine. Host machine speed and execution of
concurrent host programs will not affect the number of simulated
instructions executed for a given operation.

A device configured to use *calibrated timing* selects its tick counts
to align the simulated operation periods with the corresponding time
periods on the host system. In calibrated-time mode, an operation taking
ten milliseconds in hardware will complete after ten milliseconds has
elapsed on the host system. Because the simulator is generally one or
two orders of magnitude faster than the hardware, a software program
will execute far more code during a device operation than it would do on
a real machine. In this mode, the amount of code that executes will vary
with the speed of the host machine and the load placed on that machine
by other concurrent processes, as the simulator continually adjusts the
tick counts up and down to maintain synchronization with the host time.

A device configured to use *optimized timing* selects its tick counts to
minimize the operation delays. In fast-time mode, an operation taking
ten milliseconds in hardware will complete after the minimum amount of
time acceptable to the executing software has elapsed. In this mode,
device operations complete far more quickly than they do in hardware.
There are limits, however, to how fast I/O operations may occur without
causing software malfunctions. In practice, system software often
contains assumptions regarding the time certain operations take, so
event timing may not be arbitrarily reduced. For instance, an I/O driver
may "know" that a line printer takes 50 milliseconds to print a line,
and therefore it can ignore interrupts safely for several milliseconds
after initiating the print cycle. If the printing time is reduced below
that threshold, the driver may fail to operate correctly. The default
optimized-timing settings have been empirically determined to work with
the supported operating systems listed above, and each device simulator
allows the user to modify those settings via registers if needed.

To illustrate how the modes affect timing, consider a simulation of a
Teletype terminal that operates at 10 characters per second. If the
simulator runs 15 times faster than a real machine, then a user would
observe that printing 100 characters takes:

-   10 seconds in CALTIME mode\
    > (100 characters × *n* event ticks per character adjusted to take
    > exactly 100 mS each on the host system)

-   667 milliseconds in REALTIME mode\
    > (100 characters × 157,729 event ticks per character × 0.634 µS per
    > tick ÷ 15 times hardware speed)

-   845 microseconds in FASTTIME mode\
    > (100 characters × 200 event ticks per character × 0.634 µS per
    > tick ÷ 15 times hardware speed)

If the SCP ***SET THROTTLE*** command is used to reduce the speed of the
simulator, CALTIME operations will not be affected, but REALTIME and
FASTTIME operations will slow proportionally. Reducing simulator speed
to that of the original hardware will cause REALTIME operation times to
equal CALTIME times.

Devices offer only those modes that are generally useful. For example,
the HP 12539C Time Base Generator may be configured to use REALTIME or
CALTIME modes. The real-time mode will satisfy the expectations of the
TBG diagnostic that checks the timing of operations via delay loops,
whereas the calibrated mode will update the DOS, RTE, and TSB
time-of-day clocks as expected by users of the simulated system.
FASTTIME mode is not offered, as it makes no sense to ignore the
programmed time period settings and use a fixed arbitrary period
instead.

Devices performing input or output typically offer a REALTIME mode for
use when running the diagnostics and a FASTTIME mode for use when
running operating systems. In general, software running under simulation
will run faster when devices are configured for optimized-time mode, and
this is the default for all peripheral devices.

The Simulation Console and the System Console
---------------------------------------------

When the simulator is started, the SCP command prompt appears at the
*simulation console.* For windowed host operating systems, this is
typically the same window from which the simulator was started. Once an
execution command is entered at the simulation console, the standalone
diagnostics and the operating systems begin their user interactions at
the *system console*. The TTY device is typically used as the system
console.

For convenience and by default, the system console is initially
connected to the simulation console, so that SCP and operating system
commands may be entered from the same window. Additional "user"
terminals may be connected via Telnet or serial ports to the BACI, MPX,
or MUX devices as described later.

The system console may be separated from the simulation console by using
the ***SET CONSOLE TELNET=\<port\>*** or ***SET CONSOLE
SERIAL=\<port\>*** command. This leaves the simulation console at the
initiating window and moves the system console to a Telnet or serial
port, allowing the use of an HP terminal or terminal emulator. Entering
the ***SET CONSOLE NOTELNET*** or ***SET CONSOLE NOSERIAL*** command
will rejoin the consoles.

The Keyboard Poll Device
------------------------

The simulator obtains asynchronous external input, such as system
console keystrokes, by polling. The poll interval is selected to provide
good responsiveness while minimizing simulator overhead. Polling is
established by the Keyboard Poll device, which is scheduled by a
real-time clock with a ten-millisecond period. The device's event
service routine is entered continuously while the simulator is running.
Devices that accept asynchronous input, such as the TTY, BACI, MPX, and
MUX devices, co-schedule their event service routines with the poll
device. Entering the ***SHOW QUEUE*** command at the SCP prompt will
display the poll device and any other devices currently polling for
input.

The Keyboard Poll device provides no modifiers or registers, and it
cannot be disabled.

Tracing Simulator Operations
----------------------------

The simulator provides options for extensive tracing of the internal
operations of selected devices. This is useful as an aid to hardware and
software debugging as well as to gain an understanding of the internal
operations of the simulated devices. Devices offer multiple trace
reporting levels, from command overviews to detailed backplane signal
assertions. Tracing for each device and its separate reporting levels
may be enabled independently.

To obtain a trace, two SCP commands must be given. First, a *debug log*
must be established with the ***SET DEBUG \<target\>*** command. This
command is described in detail in the "Controlling Debugging" section of
the *SIMH Users\' Guide* manual. Typically, the target is a text file,
so that the trace may be reviewed after capture. Second, tracing must be
enabled for the desired devices with ***SET \<device\>
DEBUG=\<option\>*** commands. These are documented below in the sections
that refer to the simulated devices. The formats of the trace output are
specific to the devices being traced. Examples are provided in each
device description section below.

The reporting level options table given for each device is arranged in
order of increasing detail. The first option listed provides the
broadest overview with the least specific detail and generates the
smallest number of trace lines, thereby slowing program execution the
least. Subsequent options provide increasing detail at the expense of
larger debug log files. Enabling all trace options with a ***SET
\<device\> DEBUG*** command provides the fullest picture of device
operation but may generate very large log files.

Some options enable tracing of periodic events, e.g., a clock tick or a
device poll. Use caution when specifying these options, as the trace log
may fill rapidly. Options that trace periodic behavior are noted in the
option descriptions.

Tracing does impose some overhead on the simulator, with more detailed
tracing slowing the simulator more than higher-level tracing. No
overhead is incurred when tracing is suspended with the ***SET
NODEBUG*** command, even if individual device tracing options remain in
effect.

  ------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The abbreviated ***SET CPU 1000*** and ***SET CPU 21MX*** commands
configure the CPU models as 1000 E-Series and 1000 M-Series machines,
respectively.

If the memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated
contains non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation before
proceeding. The confirmation request may be suppressed by using the
***--F*** (force) switch. Data in the truncated portion of memory is
lost.

The following standard microcode is automatically enabled when the
applicable 1000-series CPU is selected:

  ---------------------------- ---------------------
  ***Instruction Set***        ***Applicable to***
  Extended Instruction Group   1000 M/E/F-Series
  Floating-Point Processor     1000 F-Series
  Scientific Instruction Set   1000 F-Series
  ---------------------------- ---------------------

The 1000 E/F-Series microcode self-test diagnostics are not simulated.

The ***EAU*** option simulates the installation of the 12579A Extended
Arithmetic Unit providing hardware multiply, divide, double load, double
store, and 32-bit rotate and shift instructions. EAU instructions are
standard equipment on the 2100 and 1000 CPUs.

The ***FP*** option simulates the installation of the 12901A Floating
Point firmware ROMs, providing single-precision (two-word)
floating-point add, subtract, multiply, divide, fix, and float
instructions. FP instructions are standard equipment on 1000 CPUs.

The ***IOP*** option simulates the installation of the 13206A (2100),
13207A (1000 M-Series), or 22702A (1000 E-Series) 2000/Access I/O
Processor firmware ROMs. These instructions accelerate certain common
operations of the I/O processor for the HP 2000/Access Time-Shared BASIC
operating system.

The ***DMS*** option simulates the installation of the 12731A Memory
Expansion Module and the 12976B (1000 M-Series) or 13307B (1000
E/F-Series) Dynamic Mapping System firmware ROMs, providing 38
instructions that control the MEM to expand the basic 32K-word logical
address space to a 1024K-word physical space. The MEM is automatically
enabled or disabled with the DMS instruction set.

The ***FFP*** option simulates the installation of the 12907A (2100),
12977B (1000 M-Series), or 13306B (1000 E-Series) Fast FORTRAN Processor
firmware ROMs, providing several frequently used FORTRAN operations and
extended-precision (three-word) floating-point instructions.

The ***DBI*** option simulates the installation of the 93585A Double
Integer Instructions firmware ROMs. A product of the HP "specials
group," the microcode added twelve 32-bit integer instructions to the
1000 E-Series repertoire. DBI instructions are standard equipment on the
1000 F-Series CPU.

The ***EMA*** option simulates the installation of the 92067A Extended
Memory Area firmware ROMs. The RTE-IV operating system introduced the
EMA instructions. EMA provided a mapped data area up to one megaword in
size. These three instructions accelerated data accesses to variables
stored in EMA partitions.

The ***VMAOS*** option simulates the installation of the 92084A Virtual
Memory and Operating System firmware ROMs. The RTE-6/VM operating system
introduced Virtual Memory Area (VMA) instructions --- a superset of the
RTE-IV EMA instructions --- and a set of OS instructions that accelerate
certain time-consuming internal operations.

The VMA/OS firmware cannot be installed on a 1000 M-Series; RTE-6/VM
will automatically use software replacements on this machine. The
firmware must be installed when running on 1000 E/F-Series hardware; if
it is not, the firmware self-test instruction will fail, and RTE will
halt with T = 102021. Under simulation, however, it is possible to
configure the self-test instruction to use the software simulations on
an E/F-Series. Entering the command ***SET CPU DEBUG=NOOS*** will return
a firmware revision code of 0 to RTE, which will permit the use of the
software replacements.

The ***VIS*** option simulates the installation of the 12824A (for
RTE-IVB) or 12829A (for RTE-6/VM) Vector Instruction Set ROMs, providing
vector arithmetic instructions using single- and double-precision
values. Vectors may reside either in EMA/VMA or in regular memory.

The ***SIGNAL*** option simulates the installation of the 92835A
SIGNAL/1000 firmware ROMs. These instructions provide fast Fourier
transforms and complex arithmetic. They use the F-Series floating-point
processor and the Vector Instruction Set.

The 2100 and 1000 CPUs support user microprogramming. Under simulation,
execution on these machines of all instructions in the octal ranges
101400-101777 (2100 and 1000) and 105000-105777 (1000 only) that are not
allocated to installed firmware options will be dispatched to a
user-alterable module to aid in the implementation of user-written
microcode simulations. In the absence of such simulations, execution
will cause unimplemented instruction stops. See the comments in the
*hp2100\_cpu0.c* source file for details.

The 2114, 2115, 2116, and 2100 models support a protected area of memory
containing an initial binary loader. The loader always resides in the
highest 64 memory locations, regardless of capacity. Entering the ***SET
CPU LOADERENABLE*** command makes this area available. Entering the
***SET CPU LOADERDISABLE*** command renders this area non-existent, so
that reads from the area return zero, and writes to the area are
ignored. The Basic Binary Loader (BBL), configured for the select code
of the paper tape reader, initially resides in this area when the
simulator is started. The ***LOAD*** command may be used with an
appropriate device name or absolute binary file to install a different
loader, such as the Basic Binary Disc Loader (BBDL) or Basic Moving-head
Disc Loader (BMDL).

The ***SET CPU ROMS*** command is used to change the set of installed
boot loader ROMs on the 1000 M/E/F-Series of machines. It is described
in the Bootstrap Loaders section below.

When enabled by a ***SET CPU IDLE*** command, execution of the idle loop
instructions within the DOS and RTE operating systems will idle the
simulator. While idle, the simulator does not use any host system
processor time. Idle detection is operating-system specific and is
disabled by default. When disabled, the simulator will use 100% of the
host-processor CPU time while executing simulated instructions.

Instruction execution trace behavior changes when idling is enabled. See
the Tracing section below for details.

The ***SET CPU STOP*** command enables one or more simulation stop
conditions, ***SET CPU NOSTOP*** disables the specified conditions, and
***SET CPU INDIR*** sets the maximum number of indirection levels
permitted. These commands are described in the Simulation Stops section
below.

The ***SET CPU EXEC*** command configures instruction execution tracing.
This command is described in the Tracing section below.

The CPU models and feature applicability are shown in the following
table:

  ------------------------------------------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ -------------- -------------- --------------

If a feature is standard for a given CPU, it cannot be disabled; if a
feature is unavailable, it cannot be enabled.

On the 2100, the FP or FFP option and the IOP option are mutually
exclusive. On the 1000 E/F-Series, the RTE-IV EMA and RTE-6/VM VMA and
OS options are mutually exclusive.

Setting the CPU model establishes a consistent set of standard features
and common options. Additional ***SET CPU*** commands may follow to
fine-tune the desired feature set.

The CPU configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  ***Command***         ***Action***
  **SHOW CPU**          Display the device configuration
  **SHOW CPU ROMS**     Display the set of installed boot loader ROMs
  **SHOW CPU IOCAGE**   Display the set of installed I/O interfaces
  **SHOW CPU STOPS**    Display the enabled simulation stops
  **SHOW CPU INDIR**    Display the indirect chain length limit
  **SHOW CPU EXEC**     Display the matching criteria for execution tracing
  **SHOW CPU SPEED**    Display the current simulation speed
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------------

The current simulation speed, expressed as a multiple of the speed of a
real HP 1000 E-Series, may be obtained with the ***SHOW CPU SPEED***
command. The speed reported will not be representative if the simulator
was idling when it was stopped.

### Bootstrap Loaders

When the CPU is configured as a 2114, 2115, 2116, or 2100, the Basic
Binary Loader is initially installed in the highest 64 words of core
memory. The BBL reads an absolute binary program from the paper tape
reader into memory. Alternate loaders for other devices may be installed
by entering ***LOAD*** commands as described above.

To execute the BBL, the following sequence of commands is used:

ATTACH PTR \<tape-image-filename\>\
SET CPU LOADERENABLE\
DEPOSIT S \<value\>\
DEPOSIT P \<address\>\
RESET\
GO

\...where *address* is the appropriate loader starting address --- 07700
for 4K, 17700 for 8K, 27700 for 12K, 37700 for 16K, 57700 for 24K, or
77700 for 32K. The S-register value is set to 000000 to load the paper
tape, 000001 to verify the paper tape, or 100000 to compare the paper
tape to memory. Loader execution ends with one of the following halt
instructions:

-   HLT 00 --- the tape does not compare with memory; A = the tape value
    > that did not compare.

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the tape value, B = the
    > calculated value.

-   HLT 55 --- the load address would overlay the BBL.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of tape was reached with a successful read.

The loader is automatically disabled when the CPU executes the halt
instruction within the loader.

1000-series CPUs contain up to four Initial Binary Loaders stored in
ROM. In hardware, a loader is selected by setting S register bits 15-14
to the ROM number, bits 13-12 and 5-0 to the ROM-specific options, and
bits 11-6 to the device select code. Then the IBL, PRESET, and RUN
front-panel buttons are pressed in sequence to copy the selected ROM
into the highest 64 words of memory, initialize the I/O device
interfaces, and begin execution.

In simulation, the ***LOAD CPU*** command implements the IBL facility.
The following set of ROMs is initially installed in the CPU:

  ------------------ ---------------------- -------------------------------- -------------------
  ***ROM Number***   ***Product Number***   ***Boot Device Description***    ***Boot Device***
  00                 12992K                 2748B paper tape reader          PTR
  01                 12992A                 7900 or 2883 disc                DPC or DQC
  10                 12992D                 7970B or 7970E magnetic tape     MSC
  11                 12992B                 7905, 7906, 7920, or 7925 disc   DS
  ------------------ ---------------------- -------------------------------- -------------------

To copy and execute a loader, the following sequence of commands is
used:

ATTACH \<dev\> \<image-filename\>\
DEPOSIT S \<value\>\
LOAD CPU\
RESET\
GO

A successful copy will set the O (overflow) register to 0 and the P
register to the starting address of the loader. If bits 15-14 of the S
register specify an empty ROM socket, the command will be rejected with
a **Non-existent device** error. If the select code specified in the S
register is invalid (less than 10 octal), the O register will be set to
1, and the command will be rejected with an **Invalid argument** error.
The P register and memory will not be altered in either case. No error
is reported if the select code does not reference the correct device.
The ***BOOT CPU*** command may be used in place of the ***LOAD
CPU***-***RESET***-***GO*** sequence. The specific S-register
configurations required, supported image file types, and the associated
loader halt codes are listed under their respective devices below.

The set of boot loaders installed in a 1000-series CPU may be changed
with the following command:

SET CPU ROMS=\<rom-list\>

The ROM list may be omitted or contain from one to four device names,
separated by semicolons, that specify the corresponding loaders to
install in the ROM sockets. All four ROM sockets are altered for each
command. If no devices are specified, then all sockets are emptied.
Otherwise, specifying a valid device name installs the device loader ROM
into the socket corresponding to the position of the device name in the
list. Sockets may be left empty by omitting the corresponding device
name or by supplying fewer than four device names. For example:

  --------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Command***               ***Action***
  **SET CPU ROMS=**           Remove ROMs from sockets 0-3
  **SET CPU ROMS=PTR**        Install the PTR ROM in socket 0; leave sockets 1-3 empty
  **SET CPU ROMS=DS;MS**      Install the DS ROM in 0 and the MS ROM in 1; leave 2 and 3 empty
  **SET CPU ROMS=;;DPC**      Install the DPC ROM in 2; leave 0, 1, and 3 empty
  **SET CPU ROMS=DQC;;;DA**   Install the DQC ROM in 0 and the DA ROM in 3; leave 1 and 2 empty
  --------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------

The current CPU model must be a 1000-series machine, and each device
must be bootable and have a loader ROM assigned, or the command will be
rejected. A rejected command does not alter any of the ROM assignments.

The ***SHOW CPU ROMS*** command displays the set of loader ROMs
currently installed. For example:

Socket Device ROM Description\
\-\-\-\-\-- \-\-\-\-\--
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\
0 PTR 12992K Paper Tape Loader\
1 DQC 12992A 7900/7901/2883 Disc Loader\
2 MSC 12992D 7970 Magnetic Tape Loader\
3 DS 12992B 7905/7906/7920/7925 Disc Loader

The ***SHOW CPU IOCAGE*** command displays the set of interfaces
currently installed in the I/O card cage. For example:

SC Device Interface Description\
\-- \-\-\-\-\--
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\
10 PTR 12597A-002 Tape Reader Interface\
11 TBG 12539C Time Base Generator Interface\
12 DS 13175D Disc Controller Interface\
13 MSD 13181B/13183B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interface Data Channel\
14 MSC 13181B/13183B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interface Command

15 (none) 12777A Priority Jumper Card\
16 TTY 12531C Buffered Teleprinter Interface\
17 PTP 12597A-005 Tape Punch Interface\
20 LPT 12845B Line Printer Interface

The devices appear in select code order, beginning with select code 10
and ending with the last occupied select code. Empty card cage slots
between devices behave as though they contain HP 12777A Priority Jumper
Cards as shown above. Multiple devices assigned to the same select code
are reported as a conflict. For instance:

sim\> SET PTP SC=12\
sim\> SHOW CPU IOCAGE\
\
Select code 12 conflict (PTP and DS)\
\
SC Device Interface Description\
\-- \-\-\-\-\--
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\
10 PTR 12597A-002 Tape Reader Interface\
11 TBG 12539C Time Base Generator Interface\
12 \-\-- (multiple assignments)\
13 MSD 13181B/13183B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interface Data Channel\
14 MSC 13181B/13183B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interface Command
Channel\
15 (none) 12777A Priority Jumper Card\
16 TTY 12531C Buffered Teleprinter Interface\
17 (none) 12777A Priority Jumper Card\
20 LPT 12845B Line Printer Interface

The simulator will not begin program execution until the conflict is
resolved.

### Simulation Stops

The simulator can be configured to detect certain machine instruction
conditions and stop execution when one of them occurs. Stops may be
enabled or disabled individually with these commands:

SET CPU STOP=\<option\>\[;\<option\]\
SET CPU NOSTOP=\<option\>\[;\<option\]

The ***SET CPU STOP*** and ***SET CPU NOSTOP*** commands enable or
disable all of the configurable stops.

These options control the simulation stop conditions:

  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Stop Condition***
  **UNIMPL**     Stop when an unimplemented instruction is executed
  **UNDEF**      Stop when an undefined instruction is executed
  **UNSC**       Stop when an unused select code is referenced
  **IOERR**      Stop when an unreported I/O error occurs
  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------

Setting the ***UNIMPL*** option stops the simulator if execution of an
unimplemented instruction is attempted. An instruction is unimplemented
if it is provided by a firmware option that is not currently installed
(e.g., a DAD instruction when the double-integer firmware is not
installed) or is an opcode provided by an installed option but not
assigned to an instruction (e.g., opcode 105335 from the double-integer
firmware set). If the stop is not set, unimplemented instructions
execute as NOP (no-operation), as in hardware.

Setting the ***UNDEF*** option stops the simulator if execution is
attempted of an instruction containing a decoded reserved bit pattern
other than the one defined in the Operating and Reference Manual for the
CPU. For example, opcodes 101700 and 105700 are not defined as DMS
instructions, but the microcode executes them as XMM instructions,
rather than as NOPs. The EAU opcode 100060 is defined as the 1000
E/F-Series TIMER instruction; it is undefined on other machines, but it
executes as MPY on the M-Series and NOP on the 2100. The intent of this
stop is to catch instructions containing reserved fields with values
that change the meaning of those instructions. If the stop is not set,
undefined instructions execute in the same manner as on the selected CPU
hardware.

Certain programs, such as the HP diagnostic configurator, intentionally
execute unimplemented instructions to determine the CPU model and
configuration. For example, the configurator executes an RRR 16
instruction to detect the presence of the EAU. If the EAU is installed,
the A- and B-register contents are exchanged; otherwise, the instruction
executes as NOP, and the contents are unaltered. Also, the 1000 M-Series
is differentiated from the E/F-Series by executing the TIMER
instruction; on the M-Series, it decodes as MPY and so returns to P+2,
while TIMER returns to P+1 on the E/F-Series. Enabling the ***UNIMPL***
and ***UNDEF*** options prevent this feature detection code from working
as expected. Disabling or bypassing these stops is required to permit
correct operation.

Setting the ***UNSC*** option stops the simulator if an I/O instruction
references the select code of an I/O backplane slot that does not
contain an interface card. If this option is not set, referencing an
empty slot results in a no-operation, as in hardware.

Setting the ***IOERR*** option stops the simulator if an I/O error
occurs on a device that does not return error status to the CPU. For
example, the paper tape punch returns low- or out-of-tape status, the
line printer returns out-of-paper and offline status, and the disc drive
returns not-ready and drive-fault status. By contrast, the paper tape
reader gives no indication that a tape is loaded. If the reader is
commanded to read when no tape is mounted, the interface hangs while
waiting for the handshake with the device to complete. In hardware, the
CPU can detect this condition only by timing the operation and
concluding that the tape is missing if the timeout is exceeded. However,
if a ***SET CPU STOP=IOERR*** command has been issued, then the
simulator will stop with an error message to permit the condition to be
fixed. For instance, attempting to read from the paper tape reader with
no paper tape image file attached will print **No tape loaded in the PTR
device** and will stop the simulator. After issuing an ***ATTACH PTR***
command to load the tape into the reader, resuming simulation will retry
the read. Devices that respond to the ***IOERR*** stop are indicated in
their respective sections below.

After a simulation stop, execution may be resumed in one of two ways. If
the cause of the stop has not been remedied and the stop option has not
been disabled, resuming execution with ***CONTINUE***, ***STEP***,
***GO***, or ***RUN*** will cause the stop to occur again. Alternately,
specifying the ***--B*** switch with any of the preceding commands will
resume execution while bypassing the stop for the current instruction.
Bypassing a stop has the following effect:

  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Bypass Action***
  **UNIMPL**     Resume execution with the instruction ignored
  **UNDEF**      Resume execution with the instruction decoded as in hardware
  **UNSC**       Resume execution with the I/O instruction ignored
  **IOERR**      Resume execution with the action as in hardware
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to these configurable stops, an unconditional simulation
stop will occur if an indirect addressing chain exceeds the maximum
length specified by a ***SET CPU INDIR=\<limit\>*** command. HP computer
family memory addresses may be indirect to indicate that the values
point to the target addresses rather than contain the target addresses.
The target of an indirect address may itself be indirect, and the CPU
follows this chain of addresses until it finds a direct address.
Indirect addressing is typically only one or two levels deep, but if the
chain loops back on itself (e.g., if an indirect address points to
itself), then instruction execution will be stopped. For example, these
commands:

DEPOSIT 0 LDA 1,I\
DEPOSIT 1 100001\
RUN 0

\...will stop the simulator with an **Indirect address loop** message.

The limit may be set to any number of levels up to 32,768. This is the
absolute maximum number of levels that can be created without an
infinite loop --- each location in memory points to the next one except
for the last, which contains the target value. In practice, anything
over a few levels likely represents a programming error. The default
setting is 16 levels.

### Stop Messages

When the CPU executes a HLT instruction, simulated execution terminates,
and control returns to the SCP prompt. The contents of the T and P
registers, and the halt instruction and the next instruction to execute
are displayed. For example:

Programmed halt, T: 102023 (HLT 23), P: 00101 (CLA,INA)\
sim\>

When the simulator stops for a user request or after reaching a
breakpoint or completing a ***STEP*** command, the P-register value and
the next instruction to execute are displayed. For example:

Simulation stopped, P: 03306 (JMP 3311)\
sim\>

If an interrupt is pending, however, the instruction contained in the
trap cell corresponding to the highest-priority interrupting device will
be displayed instead:

Simulation stopped, P: 03306 (IAK 11: JSB 1644,I)\
sim\>

This indicates that when simulation resumes, the device with select code
11 will receive the interrupt acknowledgement, and JSB 1644,I will be
executed. Note that P does not change when an interrupt occurs and a
trap cell instruction is executed.

### Tracing

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ---------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **INSTR**      Machine instructions executed
  **DATA**       Memory data accesses
  **FETCH**      Memory instruction fetches
  **REG**        Register values
  **OPND**       Memory operand values
  **EXEC**       Matching instruction execution states
  -------------- ---------------------------------------

A section of an example trace is:

> \>\>CPU instr: S 0002 05756 102705 STC 5\
> \>\>CPU fetch: S 0002 05757 105736 instruction fetch\

> 000000, E O I

The ***INSTR*** option traces instruction executions. Each instruction
is printed before it is executed.

The ***DATA*** option traces reads from and writes to memory. Each is
classified by the type of access --- data or unprotected. Normal data
accesses are translated by the current map if DMS is enabled and are
subject to memory and DMS page protections. Unprotected accesses are
translated by the specified map if DMS is enabled and have unrestricted
access to memory. Certain firmware extension instructions make
unprotected accesses through the system or user maps.

The ***FETCH*** option traces instruction fetches from memory. Interrupt
trap cell instructions and the additional words of multiword
instructions are included in this classification.

The ***REG*** option traces register values. Two sets of registers may
be printed. After executing each instruction, the accumulators, index
registers, extend and overflow registers, and the state of the interrupt
system are printed. After executing an instruction that may alter the
memory-protect or memory-expansion registers, the fence, violation, and
status registers are printed.

The ***OPND*** option traces instruction operand values. Some
instructions take memory and register operands that are difficult to
decode from ***DATA*** or ***REG*** traces. This option presents these
operands in a higher-level format. The memory bank and address values
are always those of the operands. The operand data and values printed
are specific to the instruction.

The ***EXEC*** option traces the execution of instructions that match
user-specified criteria. When a match occurs, all CPU trace options are
turned on for the duration of the execution of the matched instruction.
The prior trace settings are restored when a match fails. This option
allows detailed tracing of specified instructions while minimizing the
log file size compared to a full instruction trace.

The ***SET CPU EXEC*** command configures the match and mask values used
to qualify instructions for execution tracing. Qualification is
performed by ANDing the current instruction with the specified *mask*
value and then comparing the result with the specified *match* value. If
the *mask* value is omitted, the *match* value must match the
instruction exactly. The values are entered in the CPU's data radix,
which defaults to octal but may be set to a different radix or
overridden by a switch on the command line.

Setting the *mask* value allows matching a range of instructions or an
instruction with a range of operand values. For example, ***SET CPU
EXEC=105240;177760*** will trace execution of all EMA or VMA firmware
instructions, ***SET CPU EXEC=102700;177700*** will trace execution of
STC instructions, and ***SET CPU EXEC=105040*** will trace execution of
FMP instructions.

If idling has been enabled with the ***SET CPU IDLE*** command, tracing
will be suspended when the simulator detects an entry into the operating
system idle loop. This is done to avoid printing the hundreds or
thousands of loop instructions that are executed while awaiting an
interrupt. Tracing is automatically resumed when the idle loop is exited
either by an interrupt or a simulation stop.

The trace formats are interpreted as follows:

Enabling CPU tracing can produce a very large number of lines very
quickly, so care should be used to enable tracing only around the area
of interest. Breakpoint actions may be used to implement this; for
example:

BREAK 100; SET CPU DEBUG; GO\
BREAK 200; SET CPU NODEBUG; GO

These commands will enable tracing when the program counter reaches
location 100 and disable tracing when it reaches location 200, thereby
producing a trace of instructions executed between locations 100 and
200. Alternately, if the execution of specific instructions is of
interest, the ***EXEC*** trace option may be used to reduce the debug
log file size.

### Registers

The CPU state contains the registers visible to the programmer and the
interrupt and dynamic mapping system control registers:

  ------------------ ------------ ------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------------------------
  ***Name***         ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Symbolic***   ***Read-Only***   ***Description***

  ------------------ ------------ ------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------------------------

The A, B, T, X, Y, and S registers may be examined or deposited using
any of the modes described in the Symbolic Display and Entry section
above.

12578A/12607B/12895A Direct Memory Access Controllers, 12897B Dual-Channel Port Controller
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct memory access controllers permit the computer to transfer data
directly between an I/O device and memory on a cycle-stealing basis.
Depending on the CPU, the device interface, and main memory speed, DMA
is capable of transferring data blocks from 1 to 32,768 words in length
at rates between 500,000 and 1,000,000 words per second.

The HP 12578A DMA controller provides two channels for the 2115 and 2116
computers. The channels support configurable byte packing and unpacking
between memory and the I/O interface; blocks are limited to 16,384 words
in length. The HP 12607B DMA controller provides a single channel for
the 2114 computer. Block length is limited to 8,192 words, and byte
packing and unpacking are not supported. The 12895A DMA controller
provides two channels for the 2100 computer, and the HP 12897B
Dual-Channel Port Controller provides two channels for the 1000
M/E/F-Series computers. Neither provides byte packing or unpacking, and
blocks up to 32,768 words may be transferred. The channels are
permanently assigned select codes 2 and 6 for channel 1, and select
codes 3 and 7 for channel 2.

The device names are ***DMA1*** for the 12607B, ***DMA1*** and
***DMA2*** for the 12578A and 12895A, and ***DCPC1*** and ***DCPC2***
for the 12897B. Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- ----------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device
  ---------------------- ----------------------------

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CMD**        Channel commands
  **CSRW**       Control, status, read, and write actions
  **SR**         Service requests received
  **DATA**       Direct memory data accesses
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CMD*** option traces the initiation and completion of channel
transfers. The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write
commands sent to the channel. The ***SR*** option traces service
requests received from the device. The ***DATA*** option traces memory
accesses performed by the port controller. The ***IOBUS*** option traces
the I/O backplane signals and data received and returned via the
controller.

The trace formats are interpreted as follows:

\>\>DCPC1 cmd: Channel transfer completed\
\>\>DCPC1 csrw: Control word 1 is STC \| CLC \| select code 23\
\>\>DCPC1 sr: Select code 23 asserted SRQ\
\>\>DCPC1 iobus: [Received data 000000 with signals STC \| CLF \| SIR \|
PRH]{.underline}

\>\>DCPC1 data: [B]{.underline} [0002]{.underline} [05757]{.underline}
[105736]{.underline} [dma write]{.underline}

Memory map (port A/port B/disabled)

Each DMA/DCPC channel state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- ---------------- -----------------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Symbolic***   ***Description***
  **XFR**      6            8                              Channel is active if \> 0

  **FLG**      1            2                              Channel is ready
  **FBF**      1            2                              Channel is ready (buffer)
  **CTL2**     1            2                              Command word 2/3 selector
  **CW1**      16           8                              Command word 1
  **CW2**      16           8                              Command word 2
  **CW3**      16           8                              Command word 3
  **BYTE**     1            2                              Byte-packing register is occupied
  **PACKER**   8            8                             Byte-packing register
  ------------ ------------ ------------- ---------------- -----------------------------------

The BYTE and PACKER registers are applicable only to the 12578A
controller. The PACKER register defaults to single-character format
display and entry but may be overridden with a numeric-format switch, if
desired.

12581A/12892B Memory Protect
----------------------------

Memory protection is standard equipment on the 2100 (although it may be
disabled by removing a jumper) and optional on the 2116 and 1000. It
provides a Fence Register whose setting divides the logical address
space of the CPU into protected and unprotected parts. When enabled,
memory locations below the fence cannot be altered, nor can execution
jump to addresses below the fence. Violations cause the offending
instruction to be aborted, the address of the instruction to be recorded
in the Violation Register, and an interrupt to select code 5. The 12892B
Memory Protect option for the 1000 has three feature options that are
implemented by jumper settings. The default configuration provides
compatibility with 12581A Memory Protect option for the 2116 and the
standard memory protection for the 2100.

Device options that may be specified are:

  -------------- ----------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **JSBIN**      Install jumper W5; default
  **JSBOUT**     Remove jumper W5
  **INTIN**      Install jumper W6; default
  **INTOUT**     Remove jumper W6
  **SEL1IN**     Install jumper W7
  **SEL1OUT**    Remove jumper W7; default
  **ENABLED**    Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**   Disable the device
  -------------- ----------------------------

W5 determines whether JSB instructions referencing memory locations 0
and 1 are legal (installed) or illegal (removed). W6 controls whether
the first three levels of indirect addressing hold off (installed) or
permit (removed) pending interrupts. W7 determines whether I/O
instructions referencing select codes other than 1 are legal (installed)
or illegal (removed). I/O instructions referencing select code 1 are
legal, and HLT instructions are illegal, regardless of the setting of
W7.

Memory Protect works in conjunction with the Memory Expansion Module to
abort programs that cause MEM violations. If Memory Protect is not
installed (i.e., is disabled), then MEM violations are recorded in the
Violation Register, but the offending program is allowed to continue.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying the reporting level option:

12731A Memory Expansion Module
------------------------------

The HP 12731A Memory Expansion Module is an option for the HP 1000
M/E/F-Series computers. The MEM provides mapping of the 32 1024-word
logical memory pages into a one-megaword physical memory. Four separate
maps are provided: system, user, DCPC port A, and DCPC port B. The MEM
is controlled by the associated Dynamic Mapping System instructions and
contains Status and Violation Registers. If the MEM is disabled, logical
memory addresses access the first 32K of physical memory. If the MEM is
enabled, logical memory addresses are translated to physical memory
addresses via the system map or user map, depending on which one is
currently enabled. DCPC memory addresses are translated via the port A
map for channel 1 accesses and the port B map for channel 2 accesses.

The MEM simulator is enabled and disabled by the ***SET CPU DMS*** and
***SET CPU NODMS*** commands, rather than the ***SET MEM ENABLED*** and
***DISABLED*** commands. The MEM state contains these registers:

  -------------------- ------------ ------------- ------------------------------------
  ***Name***           ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Description***
  **ENABLED**          1            2             Memory expansion is enabled
  **CURMAP**           1            2             The user map is currently selected
  **STATUS**           16           8             Status register
  **VIOL**             16           8             Violation register

General I/O Device Simulations
==============================

The simulator provides these general I/O device interfaces and their
associated peripherals:

-   12531C Buffered Teleprinter Interface

-   12539C Time Base Generator

-   12566B Microcircuit Interface

-   12597A-002 Tape Reader Interface

-   12597A-005 Tape Punch Interface

-   12620A/12936A Privileged Interrupt Fence

-   12653A Line Printer Interface

-   12792C 8-Channel Asynchronous Multiplexer

-   12845B Line Printer Interface

-   12875A Processor Interconnect

-   12920A Asynchronous Multiplexer Interface

-   12966A Buffered Asynchronous Communications Interface

12531C Buffered Teleprinter Interface with One 2752/54 Teleprinter
------------------------------------------------------------------

The 12531C Buffered Teleprinter Interface connects current-loop devices,
such as the HP 2752A (ASR33) and 2754A (ASR35) teleprinters, as well as
EIA RS-232 devices, such as the HP 2749A (ASR33) teleprinter and HP 2600
CRT terminal, to the HP computer family.

This simulation provides three units. Unit 0 reads from the teleprinter
keyboard. Unit 1 writes to the teleprinter printer. Unit 2 writes to the
teleprinter paper tape punch. Attaching a paper tape image file to unit
2 simulates loading blank paper tape into the punch:

ATTACH {-N} TTY2 \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--N*** (new file) switch clears the contents of the image
file if present. Without the ***--N*** switch, punch output will be
appended to any preexisting image file content. Detaching the image
simulates removing the punched tape.

The interface may be programmed to enable printing and punching
separately. Only the HP 2754A teleprinter responds to the individual
enables. All other supported devices print if either the printer or the
punch is enabled. The TTY device simulates an HP 2754A only if the punch
unit is attached. When the unit is detached, an HP 2752A is simulated,
which will print if either printing or punching is enabled.

If the host operating system returns an error when writing to the paper
tape image file, the simulator will report the error to the simulation
console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator teleprinter punch I/O error: Permission denied

\...and the simulator stops. Simulation may be resumed and the operation
retried if the problem has been corrected or with the punch operation
incomplete if the problem is uncorrectable.

Device options that may be specified are:

  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **FASTTIME**   Use optimized timing; default
  **REALTIME**   Use realistic timing
  **SC=\<n\>**   Set the interface card select code; default is 11
  **ENABLED**    Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**   Disable the device
  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------

The interface supports realistic and optimized timing modes. Realistic
timing accurately models the 10 character per second print and punch
rates (in machine instructions). Optimized timing reduces operation
delays to the minimums necessary to operate correctly; this is much
faster than a real teleprinter would operate.

The delay used by the simulator in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set via
the register interface. The value may be adjusted as necessary to work
around any HP software problems that are triggered by the unusually
rapid print and punch operations. Resetting the device with the ***RESET
--P*** (power-on reset) command restores the original optimized time.

If the TTY device disabled while the simulator is running, the
simulation console will respond only to the SCP interrupt character,
which defaults to CTRL+E.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  ------------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***       ***Action***
  **SHOW TTY**        Display the device and unit configuration
  **SHOW TTY MODE**   Display the timing mode
  ------------------- -------------------------------------------

Unit options that may be specified for the keyboard and printer are:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **UC**         Upshift lowercase characters to uppercase; default
  **7B**         Transfer characters with the high-order bit cleared
  **7P**         Transfer characters with the high-order bit cleared, non-printing suppressed
  **8B**         Transfer characters without changing
  **AUTOLF**     Enable automatic output of line-feed characters
  **NOAUTOLF**   Disable automatic output of line-feed characters; default
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The printer may be set to mode ***UC***, ***7B***, ***7P***, or
***8B***. The set of non-printing characters allowed by mode ***7P*** is
configured independently by the ***SET CONSOLE PCHAR*** command as
described in the *SIMH User's Guide* and defaults to CR, LF, HT, BS, and
BEL. The keyboard may be set to mode ***UC***, ***7B***, or ***8B***;
mode ***7P*** is not supported for input and will be changed to mode
***7B*** if specified. The default mode is ***UC*** for both units.

Some HP software systems expect the console terminal to transmit line
feed characters automatically following each carriage return. As an aid
to avoid typing LF characters after pressing ENTER, the ***AUTOLF***
option may be specified for the keyboard unit. This simulates pressing
the AUTO LF latching key on an HP 264x terminal.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CSRW**       Interface control, status, read, and write actions
  **SERV**       Printer and punch unit service events
  **PSERV**      Keyboard unit service events (periodic)
  **XFER**       Data receptions and transmissions
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands
sent to the interface. The ***SERV*** option traces print and punch
output service scheduling and entries. The ***PSERV*** option traces
keyboard poll unit service scheduling and entries. The poll service is
entered once every 10 milliseconds to poll for input characters to be
received by the interface. The ***XFER*** option traces the characters
entered at the keyboard and output to the printer and punch. The
***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and data received
and returned by the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>TTY csrw: Control is output \| printer enabled\
\>\>TTY csrw: Output data is CR\
\>\>TTY csrw: Status is idle \| \'T\'\
\>\>TTY serv: Unit delay 200 service scheduled\
\>\>TTY serv: Printer and punch service entered\
\>\>TTY pserv: Poll delay 221566 service entered\
\>\>TTY xfer: Character \'T\' entered at keyboard\
\>\>TTY xfer: Character CR sent to printer\
\>\>TTY iobus: Received data 000000 with signals IOI\
\>\>TTY iobus: Returned data 000115 with signals (none)\
\>\>TTY iobus: Received data 000000 with signals ENF \| SIR \| IEN \|
PRH\
\>\>TTY iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals FLG \| IRQ \| SRQ

The teleprinter interface state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- -----------------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Description***
  **BUF**      8            8             Output data buffer
  **MODE**     3            2             Control word bits 14-12
  **CTL**      1            2             Control flip-flop
  **FLG**      1            2             Flag flip-flop
  **FBF**      1            2             Flag buffer flip-flop
  **KPOS**     32           10            Number of characters input
  **TPOS**     32           10            Number of characters printed
  **PPOS**     32           10            Position in the punch output file
  **TTIME**    24           10            Fast print/punch time
  ------------ ------------ ------------- -----------------------------------

12539C Time Base Generator
--------------------------

The HP 12539C Time Base Generator provides a programmable interval clock
employed as the DOS, RTE, and TSB time-of-day and process-switching
clocks. The TBG provides programmable periods of 100 microseconds to
1000 seconds in decade increments. Each "tick" of the clock may request
an interrupt, and a status indication is provided if the TBG ticks a
second time without acknowledgement.

Device options that may be specified are:

  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **CALTIME**    Use calibrated timing; default
  **REALTIME**   Use realistic timing
  **W1A**        Install jumper W1 in the A position; default
  **W1B**        Install jumper W1 in the B position
  **W2A**        Install jumper W2 in the A position; default
  **W2B**        Install jumper W2 in the B position
  **SC=\<n\>**   Set the interface card select code; default is 13
  **ENABLED**    Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**   Disable the device
  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------

Calibrated timing aligns the simulated clock periods with the clock on
the host system. When calibrated, each of the programmable periods will
elapse after the corresponding amount of host-system time.

When realistic timing is enabled, the simulator models the programmable
periods in terms of machine instructions executed. Calibrated timing is
required to enable CPU idling and is generally preferred when running
operating systems that provide time-of-day clocks. Realistic timing is
necessary to pass the hardware diagnostic.

Hardware jumpers W1 and W2 may be installed in either their A or B
positions. With W1 in the A position, lost ticks are reported in bit 4
of the status word. In the B position, lost ticks are reported in both
bits 5 and 4. With W2 in the A position, the four longest intervals are
1, 10, 100, and 1000 seconds per tick. In the B position, these
intervals are divided by 1000 and tick after 1, 10, 100, and 1000
milliseconds to facilitate testing with the diagnostic.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CSRW**       Interface control, status, read, and write actions
  **PSERV**      Clock unit service events (periodic)
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands
sent to the interface. The ***PSERV*** option traces event service
scheduling and entries, which occur at a periodic rate dependent on the
programmable configuration. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O
backplane signals and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>TBG csrw: Control is 10 millisecond rate\
\>\>TBG csrw: Status is lost tick\
\>\>TBG pserv: Rate 100 millisecond delay 157729 service scheduled\
\>\>TBG iobus: Received data 000000 with signals STC \| CLF \| SIR \|
PRH\
\>\>TBG iobus: Returned data 000020 with signals PRL

The Time Base Generator state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- ----------------------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Description***
  **SEL**      3            8             Time base selector
  **CTR**      14           10            Prescale counter for \< 1 Hz operation
  **CTL**      1            2             Control flip-flop

  **FBF**      1            2             Flag buffer flip-flop
  **ERR**      1            2             Error flip-flop
  ------------ ------------ ------------- ----------------------------------------

12566B Microcircuit Interface
-----------------------------

The HP 12566B Microcircuit Interface provides a general-purpose 16-bit
bidirectional data path at TTL logic levels for interfacing to a variety
of peripheral devices. The card contains a 16-bit Data Output register
and a 16-bit Data Input register for transfers between the CPU and the
device. A Device Command signal from the card enables the device to
transfer data, while a Device Flag signal from the device indicates
transfer completion to the CPU. The card supports skip-on-flag and
interrupt I/O modes, as well as DMA transfers up to half bandwidth
(approximately 300K-400K words per second).

In simulation, this interface is not connected to an associated
peripheral. Instead, it provides a configurable target for several
diagnostics that test input, output, and interrupt responses. Two
identical cards are provided with device names MC1 and MC2. They are
disabled by default, as they are only useful when running diagnostics.

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***     ***Action***
  **DEVICE**       Remove the diagnostic loopback connector; default
  **DIAGNOSTIC**   Install the diagnostic loopback connector
  **SC=\<n\>**     Set the interface card select code; defaults are 44 and 45
  **ENABLED**      Enable the device
  **DISABLED**     Disable the device; default
  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

The ***DIAGNOSTIC*** option simulates the installation of the HP
1251-0332 diagnostic test (loopback) connector in place of the device
cable. It also configures hardware jumpers W1-W3 on the interface as
required by the following diagnostics:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ------------ ------------------------------
  ***W1***   ***W2***   ***W3***   ***DSN***    ***Diagnostic***
  **C**      **B**      **B**      **143300**   General Purpose Register
  **C**      **B**      **B**      **141203**   I/O Instruction Group
  **C**      **B**      **B**      **102103**   Memory Expansion Unit
  **C**      **B**      **B**      **101220**   DMA/DCPC for 2100/1000
  **B**      **A**      **A**      **---**      DMA for 2100 (HP 24195)
  **B**      **A**      **A**      **101105**   DMA for 2114/2115/2116
  **B**      **C**      **B**      **---**      DMA for 2115/2116 (HP 24185)
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ------------ ------------------------------

Setting the ***DEVICE*** option removes the loopback connector and
leaves the device interface disconnected.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **XFER**       Data transmissions or receptions
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***XFER*** option traces the words sent or received by the interface
during diagnostic operation. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O
backplane signals and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>MC1 xfer: Output data word 062140 looped back to input\
\>\>MC1 iobus: Received data 000000 with signals ENF \| SIR \| IEN \|
PRH\
\>\>MC1 iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals FLG \| IRQ \| SRQ\
\>\>MC2 iobus: Received data 000000 with signals IOI\
\>\>MC2 iobus: Returned data 000145 with signals (none)

  ------------ ------------ ------------- -----------------------

12597A-002 Tape Reader Interface with One 2748 Paper Tape Reader
----------------------------------------------------------------

The 12597A-002 Tape Reader Interface is an 8-bit duplex register card
that connects the HP 2748A/B Tape Reader to the HP computer family. The
2748 is a photoreader capable of reading eight-level punched paper tapes
at a rate of 500 bytes per second.

The 12597A interface contains nine configuration jumpers. These are
preset for proper tape reader operation.

The simulation provides one reader unit. Attaching a paper tape image
file to the unit:

ATTACH PTR \<image-filename\>

\... simulates pressing the LOAD button on the reader's front panel,
loading the paper tape into the reader, and pressing the READ button.

The interface does not provide status to the CPU to indicate that a tape
is not loaded or that the end of the tape has passed through the reader.
Attempting to read under these conditions will cause the reader to hang,
as it will in hardware. Specifying the ***SET CPU STOP=IOERR*** command
will cause a simulation stop with a **No tape loaded** error if either
of these conditions occur. If the error is corrected, either by
attaching the paper tape image file or by rewinding the tape, then
resuming simulation will retry the operation.

If the host operating system returns an error when reading from the
paper tape image file, the simulator will report the error to the
simulation console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator paper tape reader I/O error: Permission denied

\...and the simulator stops. Simulation may be resumed and the operation
retried if the problem has been corrected or with the reader operation
incomplete if the problem is uncorrectable.

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***     ***Action***
  **READER**       Use a normal paper tape; default
  **DIAGNOSTIC**   Use a continuous paper tape loop or loopback connector
  **FASTTIME**     Use optimized timing; default
  **REALTIME**     Use realistic timing
  **SC=\<n\>**     Set the interface card select code; default is 10
  **ENABLED**      Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**     Disable the device
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------

The simulator provides two diagnostic modes. If a paper tape image file
is not attached, then the ***DIAGNOSTIC*** option simulates the
installation of the HP 1251-0332 diagnostic test (loopback) connector in
place of the reader cable. This is needed to run the General Purpose
Register Diagnostic (DSN 143300) as well as to serve as the standard I/O
card for several other diagnostics that test interrupts. If a file is
attached, then the ***DIAGNOSTIC*** option converts the paper tape image
into a continuous loop by logically joining the ends of the tape. This
is used by the High-Speed Tape Reader/Punch Diagnostic (DSN 146200).
Setting the ***READER*** option returns the tape image to its normal
linear configuration.

The reader supports realistic and optimized timing modes. Realistic
timing attempts to model the paper tape movement delay inherent in the
physical hardware. Optimized timing reduces the operation delay to the
minimum necessary to operate correctly; this is much faster than a real
reader would operate.

The delay used by the simulation in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set via
the register interface. The value may be adjusted as necessary to work
around any HP software problems that are triggered by the unusually
rapid reading operations. Resetting the device with the ***RESET --P***
(power-on reset) command restores the original optimized time.

The interface supports the ***LOAD PTR*** and ***BOOT PTR*** commands to
load an absolute binary paper tape image into memory. Depending on the
current CPU model, the ***LOAD*** command copies either the Basic Binary
Loader (BBL) or the 12992K boot loader ROM into memory, configures it
for the interface's select code, and sets the P register to the loader's
starting address. The ***BOOT*** command performs these same actions and
then presets the system and begins execution.

For a 2100/14/15/16 CPU containing a previously configured BBL in
memory, the commands are equivalent in hardware to setting the P
register to the starting address, pressing the LOADER ENABLE button on
the front panel, and, for the ***BOOT*** command, pressing the INTERNAL
PRESET, EXTERNAL PRESET, and RUN buttons to begin execution. Before
execution, the S register must be set as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***   ***10***   ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***
            0          0          0          0          0          0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

If bit 15 is set to 1, the loader will compare the absolute program on
tape to the contents of memory. If bit 0 is set to 1, the loader will
verify the checksums of the absolute binary records on tape without
altering memory. If neither bit is set, the loader will read the
absolute program on the paper tape into memory. Loader execution ends
with one of the following halt instructions:

-   HLT 00 --- a comparison error occurred; A = the tape value.

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the tape value, B = the
    > calculated value.

-   HLT 55 --- the program load address would overlay the loader.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of tape was reached with a successful read.

For a 1000 M/E/F-Series CPU, the commands are equivalent in hardware to
setting the S register to select and configure the HP 12992K boot loader
ROM, pressing the IBL button to copy the ROM into memory, and, for the
***BOOT*** command, pressing the PRESET and RUN buttons to begin
execution. The S register is preset as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***          ***10***   ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

Loader execution ends with one of the following halt instructions:

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the calculated value, B =
    > the tape value.

-   HLT 55 --- the load address would overlay the ROM loader.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of tape was reached with a successful read.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **SERV**       Reader unit service events
  **XFER**       Data bytes read from the tape
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***SERV*** option traces reader event service scheduling and
entries. The ***XFER*** option traces the bytes received from the
reader. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and data
received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>PTR serv: Unit delay 3155 service scheduled\
\>\>PTR serv: Reader service entered\
\>\>PTR xfer: Data 145 character \'e\' received from reader\
\>\>PTR iobus: Received data 000000 with signals ENF \| SIR \| IEN \|
PRH\
\>\>PTR iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals FLG \| IRQ \| SRQ\
\>\>PTR iobus: Received data 000000 with signals IOI\
\>\>PTR iobus: Returned data 000145 with signals (none)

The paper tape reader state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Description***
  **BUF**      8            8             Input data buffer
  **CTL**      1            2             Control flip-flop
  **FLG**      1            2             Flag flip-flop
  **FBF**      1            2             Flag buffer flip-flop
  **TRLLIM**   8            10            Trailing feed frame limit
  **POS**      32           10            Paper tape image file position
  **TIME**     24           10            Fast read time
  ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------------------------

The TRLLIM register specifies the number of feed frames (zero bytes) to
supply as paper tape trailer when the end of the tape image file is
reached; the default is 40 frames. If input is attempted when TRLLIM is
set to zero or the count is exhausted, the reader will hang. The POS
register specifies the current file position of the next data byte to
read. Setting POS to 0 rewinds the attached tape.

12597A-005 Tape Punch Interface with One 2895 Paper Tape Punch
--------------------------------------------------------------

The 12597A-005 Tape Punch Interface is an 8-bit duplex register card
that connects the HP 2895A/B Tape Punch to the HP computer family. The
2895 is an eight-level paper tape punch capable of punching at a rate of
75 bytes per second.

The 12597A interface contains nine configuration jumpers. These are
preset for proper tape punch operation.

The simulation provides one punch unit. Attaching a paper tape image
file to the unit simulates loading blank paper tape into the punch:

ATTACH {-N} PTP \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--N*** (new file) switch clears the contents of the image
file if present. Without the ***--N*** switch, punch output will be
appended to any preexisting image file content. Detaching the image
simulates removing the punched tape.

If the host operating system returns an error when writing to the paper
tape image file, the simulator will report the error to the simulation
console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator paper tape punch I/O error: No space left on device

\...and the simulator stops. Simulation may be resumed and the operation
retried if the problem has been corrected or with the punch operation
incomplete if the problem is uncorrectable.

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***     ***Action***
  **PUNCH**        Connect to the paper tape punch; default
  **DIAGNOSTIC**   Use a loopback connector
  **FASTTIME**     Use optimized timing; default
  **REALTIME**     Use realistic timing
  **SC=\<n\>**     Set the interface card select code; default is 12
  **ENABLED**      Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**     Disable the device
  ---------------- ---------------------------------------------------

Setting the ***DIAGNOSTIC*** option simulates the installation of the HP
1251-0332 diagnostic test (loopback) connector in place of the punch
cable. This is needed to run the General Purpose Register Diagnostic
(DSN 143300) as well as to serve as the standard I/O card for several
other diagnostics that test interrupts. Setting the ***PUNCH*** option
reinstalls the standard punch cable.

The punch supports realistic and optimized timing modes. Realistic
timing attempts to model the punch and tape advance delays inherent in
the physical hardware. Optimized timing reduces the operation delays to
the minimums necessary to operate correctly; this is much faster than a
real punch would operate.

The delay used by the simulation in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set via
the register interface. The value may be adjusted as necessary to work
around any HP software problems that are triggered by the unusually
rapid punching operations. Resetting the device with the ***RESET --P***
(power-on reset) command restores the original optimized time.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CSRW**       Interface control, status, read, and write actions
  **SERV**       Punch unit service events
  **XFER**       Data bytes written to the tape
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands
sent to the interface. The ***SERV*** option traces punch event service
scheduling and entries. The ***XFER*** option traces the bytes sent to
the punch. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and
data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>PTP csrw: Status is tape low\
\>\>PTP serv: Unit delay 20978 service scheduled\
\>\>PTP serv: Punch service entered\
\>\>PTP xfer: Data 045 character \'%\' sent to punch\
\>\>PTP iobus: Received data 000045 with signals IOO\
\>\>PTP iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals (none)\
\>\>PTP iobus: Received data 000000 with signals STC \| CLF \| SIR\
\>\>PTP iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals (none)

The paper tape punch state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Description***
  **BUF**      8            8             Output data buffer
  **CTL**      1            2             Control flip-flop
  **FLG**      1            2             Flag flip-flop
  **FBF**      1            2             Flag buffer flip-flop
  **POS**      32           10            Paper tape image file position
  **TIME**     24           10            Fast punch time
  ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------------------------

12620A/12936A Privileged Interrupt Fence
----------------------------------------

The Privileged Interrupt Fence (PIF) is used in DOS and RTE systems to
provide privileged interrupt capability. The PIF is installed in the I/O
backplane to separate privileged from unprivileged devices by
controlling the interrupt priority chain signal (PRL) to lower-priority
devices. The privileged cards located below the fence are allowed to
interrupt the operating system and the service routines of the
unprivileged cards located above the fence. Privileged devices employ
specially written device drivers that bypass the operating system during
interrupts. This provides very fast interrupt service time.

HP produced two PIF cards: the 12620A Breadboard Interface for the RTE
operating systems, and the 12936A Privileged Interrupt Fence Accessory
for DOS. They behave quite differently and are not interchangeable.

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **12620A**             Use a 12620A RTE fence; default
  **12936A**             Use a 12936A DOS fence
  **SC=\<n\>**           Set the interface card select code; default is 37
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  -------------------- ---------------------------------
  ***Command***        ***Action***
  **SHOW PIF TYPE**    Display the current fence type
  **SHOW PIF DEBUG**   Display the current debug state
  -------------------- ---------------------------------

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CMD**        Interface commands
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CMD*** option traces commands executed by the interface. The
***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and data received
and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>PIF cmd: Control reset\
\>\>PIF cmd: Fence allows lower-priority interrupts\
\>\>PIF cmd: Fence inhibits lower-priority interrupts\
\>\>PIF iobus: Received data 000000 with signals SFS \| PRH\
\>\>PIF iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals SKF \| PRL

Because the PIF is accessed twice for each unprivileged interrupt,
systems employing the 12539C Time Base Generator will generate a large
number of debug statements very quickly. In such cases, tracing should
be enabled for the minimum time necessary.

The Privileged Interrupt Fence state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- -----------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Description***
  **CTL**      1            2             Control flip-flop
  **FLG**      1            2             Flag flip-flop
  **FBF**      1            2             Flag Buffer flip-flop
  ------------ ------------ ------------- -----------------------

12653A Line Printer Interface with One 2767 Line Printer
--------------------------------------------------------

The HP 12653A Line Printer Interface connects the HP 2767A line printer
to the HP computer family. The printer provides 80-column output at
rates from 356 to 1110 lines per minute, depending on the number of
columns printed. It uses a 64-character repertoire (ASCII codes 32
through 95), prints a fixed 60 lines per page, and automatically skips
page perforations. It does not have a vertical format unit (VFU) but
will slew to the top-of-form upon receipt of a form-feed character.

The simulation provides one printer unit. Attaching a text file to the
unit simulates loading paper into the printer:

ATTACH {-N} LPS \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--N*** (new file) switch clears the contents of the image
file if present. Without the ***--N*** switch, printer output will be
appended to any preexisting image file content.

Printer output written to the image file is typically buffered by the
host operating system's underlying stream I/O routines. While it is
running, the simulator flushes the file after each printer top-of-form
request to permit convenient inspection of the image file. Stopping the
simulator also flushes the file.

If the host operating system returns an error when writing to the
printer image file, the simulator will report the error to the
simulation console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator printer I/O error: No space left on device

The printer goes offline, and the simulator stops. Simulation may then
be resumed, either with the printer set back online if the problem is
fixed, or with the printer remaining offline if the problem is
uncorrectable.

Device and unit options include configuring the printer type and timing,
turning the printer power off and on, and the ability to set the printer
offline or online. The command forms are:

SET LPS \<device-option\>\
SET LPS \<unit-option\>

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **FASTTIME**           Use optimized timing; default
  **REALTIME**           Use realistic timing
  **PRINTER**            Install the standard printer cable; default
  **DIAGNOSTIC**         Install the diagnostic loopback connector
  **SC=\<n\>**           Set the interface card select code; default is 14
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device; default
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

The printer supports realistic and optimized timing modes. Realistic
timing attempts to model the print buffer load and print-and-space
operation delays inherent in the physical hardware. For example, output
of lines with more characters takes longer than output of lines with
fewer characters, and spacing six lines takes approximately six times
longer than spacing one line.

Optimized timing reduces operation delays to the minimums necessary to
operate correctly; this is much faster than a real line printer would
operate.

The delays used by the simulation in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set via
the register interface. The values may be adjusted as necessary to work
around any HP software problems that are triggered by the unusually
rapid print operations. Resetting the device with the ***RESET --P***
(power-on reset) command restores the original optimized times.

The ***DIAGNOSTIC*** option simulates the installation of the HP
1251-0332 diagnostic test (loopback) connector in place of the printer
cable. This is needed to run the General Purpose Register Diagnostic
(DSN 143300) as well as to serve as the standard I/O card for several
other diagnostics that test interrupts.

Setting the ***PRINTER*** option reinstalls the standard printer cable.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  --------------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***         ***Action***
  **SHOW LPS**          Display the device and unit configuration
  **SHOW LPS TIMING**   Display the timing mode
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------

Unit options that may be specified are:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **OFFLINE**    Set the printer offline; default when detached
  **ONLINE**     Set the printer online; default when attached
  **POWEROFF**   Turn the printer power off
  **POWERON**    Turn the printer power on; default
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------

The ***OFFLINE*** and ***ONLINE*** options place the printer offline and
online, respectively. The former provides a convenient method of setting
the printer \"down\" without detaching the associated output file.

Entering the ***SET LPS POWEROFF*** command simulates removing power
from the line printer. A ***SET LPS POWERON*** command restores power to
the printer.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CMDS**       Command initiations and completions
  **CPU**        Words received from and sent to the CPU
  **XFER**       Data receptions and transmissions
  **STATE**      Printer state transitions
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CMDS*** option traces the commands executed by the printer. The
***CPU*** option traces words received from (control and write data) and
sent to (status and read data) the CPU. The ***XFER*** option traces the
characters sent to the printer. The ***STATE*** option traces printer
state changes. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals
and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>LPS cmds: Character \'M\' scheduled for line 6, column 20, time =
13825\
\>\>LPS cmds: Character CR scheduled for line 6, column 81, time = 0\
\>\>LPS cpu: Control 000015 (CR) output\
\>\>LPS cpu: Status 100001 returned\
\>\>LPS xfer: Character \'D\' printed\
\>\>LPS xfer: Character ETX erased\
\>\>LPS state: Power state is OFF\
\>\>LPS state: Power state is TURNING ON, scheduled time = 39500\
\>\>LPS iobus: Received data 000000 with signals CLC \| CLF \| SIR \|

  ------------ ------------ ------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------------------------

The BUF register may be displayed in character format, if desired.
Symbolic entry is also supported.

12792C 8-Channel Asynchronous Multiplexer
-----------------------------------------

The 12792C is an eight-channel asynchronous serial multiplexer that
connects terminals, modems, serial line printers, and \"black box\"
devices that use the RS-232 standard to the CPU. It uses an on-board Z80
microprocessor and provides input and output buffering to support
block-mode reads from HP 264x and 262x terminals at speeds up to 19.2K
baud. The interface handles character editing, echoing, ENQ/ACK
handshaking, and read terminator detection, substantially reducing the
load on the CPU over the earlier 12920A multiplexer.

There are four major revisions to the multiplexer firmware, designated
revisions A-D. Revisions A-C have an upward-compatible command set and
are supported under RTE-M, RTE-IVB, and RTE-6/VM. Revision D implements
completely different commands, requires different RTE drivers, and is
supported only under RTE-6/VM. This simulation implements revision C.

Revisions B and C added support for the 37214A Systems Modem subsystem
and the RTE-A Virtual Control Panel (VCP), as the same firmware was used
in the A-Series version of the multiplexer, the HP 12040B/C. Under
simulation, the modem commands return status codes indicating that no
modems are present, and the VCP commands are not implemented.

After pressing the CPU front-panel PRESET button or executing a CLC 0
instruction, the multiplexer enters "echoplex" mode. In this mode, each
channel defaults to 9600 baud, 8 bits per character, 1 stop bit, no
parity, and echoes characters as they are received. Echoplex is
implemented under simulation --- until a channel is configured by the
appropriate RTE driver control call, characters entered in a Telnet
session will be echoed.

The 12792C has two baud-rate generators that are assigned to channels by
the wiring configuration in the I/O cable connector hood. Two
counter/timer circuits on the interface are used to implement the BRGs
for all eight channels. For channels connected to the same BRG, only
subsets of the configurable rates are allowed, and assigning mutually
incompatible rates causes corruption of the rates on channels assigned
earlier. Under simulation, any baud rate may be assigned to any channel
without interaction.

While the multiplexer can connect to generic Telnet clients, RTE
programs generally assumed the use of HP terminals.

Under simulation, the multiplexer performs input and output through
Telnet sessions connected to a user-specified port or through
individually specified host serial ports. It supports concurrent Telnet
and serial connections. The ***ATTACH*** command specifies the local
port to be used for Telnet connections:

ATTACH MPX \<port\>

\...where ***port*** is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not
being used for other TCP/IP activities. When the multiplexer is attached
and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens for connections on
the specified port and assigns them to channels in ascending numeric
order, unless an alternate connection order has been specified.

The ***ATTACH*** command is also used to specify the host serial port
for individual multiplexer channels:

ATTACH {--V} MPX
LINE=\<line\>,CONNECT=\<name\>{;\<rate\>-\<size\>\<parity\>\<stopbits\>}

\...where ***line*** is the multiplexer channel number from 0-7, and
***name*** is the host name of the serial port to use (e.g., *ser0* or
*COM1*). If the ***--V*** (verbose) option is included, a connection
confirmation message will be output to the port.

An optional serial port configuration string may be supplied after the
host name. The required values are:

-   ***rate*** is the baud rate in bits per second.

-   ***size*** is the character size in bits including the parity bit,
    > if designated.

-   ***parity*** designates the parity to use: *N* (no), *E* (even), *O*
    > (odd), *M* (mark), or *S* (space).

-   ***stopbits*** is the number of stop bits (*1*, *1.5*, or *2*).

Serial connections default to 9600 baud, 8-bit characters, no parity,
and one stop bit.

Configuration options are available for the device and for the
individual units. The command forms are:

SET MPX \<device-option\>\
SET MPXn \<unit-option\>

### Device Options

Device options that may be specified are:

  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***                          ***Action***
  **LINEORDER=\<c1\>\[;\<c2\>\...\]**   Set the channel connection order
  **DISCONNECT=\<chan\>**               Disconnect the specified channel
  **SC=\<n\>**                          Set the interface card select code; default is 36
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**                  Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**                           Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**                           Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**                          Disable the device
  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

The ***LINEORDER*** option specifies the order in which new connections
are assigned to multiplexer channels. The arguments may be single
channel numbers or ranges of channel numbers of the form ***m-n***.
Telnet connections to the listening port will be assigned to multiplexer
channels in the sequence specified. In the absence of a ***SET MPX
LINEORDER*** command, connections will be assigned by default in
ascending channel order. The default order may be reestablished by
specifying the command ***SET MPX LINEORDER=ALL***.

A channel may be manually disconnected from its associated Telnet
session with the ***SET MPX DISCONNECT=\<chan\>*** command. Otherwise,
the connection will remain open until disconnected either by the Telnet
client or a ***DETACH MPX*** command. For a serial connection, the
command will drop and then raise the Data Terminal Ready line; to
disconnect the serial port, include the ***--C*** switch in the command.

### Unit Options

Unit options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **FASTTIME**           Use optimized timing; default
  **REALTIME**           Use realistic timing
  **CAPSLOCK**           Upshift lowercase input characters to uppercase
  **NOCAPSLOCK**         Input characters are unchanged; default
  **LOG=\<filename\>**   Enable I/O logging
  **NOLOG**              Disable I/O logging; default
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------

The 12792C supports twelve programmable baud rates from 50 to 19200
baud. When realistic timing is enabled, the simulation accurately models
the transmission and reception baud rates (in machine instructions). For
example, setting the interface to 1200 baud will take twice as long to
output a given listing as setting the interface to 2400 baud. Optimized
timing reduces the timing to the minimum necessary to operate correctly;
this is much faster than a real multiplexer would operate.

Setting the multiplexer to fast timing also enables three optimizations.
First, buffered characters are transferred via Telnet in blocks, rather
than one character at a time. Second, ENQ/ACK handshaking is done
locally, without involving the Telnet client. Third, when editing and
echo is enabled, entering BS echoes a backspace, a space, and a
backspace, and entering DEL echoes a backslash, a carriage return, and a
line feed, providing better compatibility with prior RTE terminal
drivers.

Many HP operating systems require command input in upper case, although
mixed-case output is supported. As an aid to avoid toggling the host
keyboard in and out of CAPS LOCK mode, the multiplexer provides this
function locally. The default mode is ***NOCAPSLOCK***.

Each multiplexer channel supports independent I/O logging to a file.
Disabling logging also closes the log file.

The device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  -------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Command***              ***Action***
  **SHOW MPX**               Display the device configuration
  **SHOW MPX LINEORDER**     Display the channel connection order
  **SHOW MPX CONNECTIONS**   Display the channel connections
  **SHOW MPX STATISTICS**    Display the channel I/O statistics for the active connections
  -------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

The unit configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  ***Command***           ***Action***
  **SHOW MPX\<n\>**       Display the selected channel's configuration
  **SHOW MPX\<n\> LOG**   Display the selected channel's logging status
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------

### Tracing and Registers

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CMDS**       Command initiations and completions
  **CPU**        Words received from and sent to the CPU
  **BUF**        Data read from and written to the channel buffers
  **XFER**       Data receptions and transmissions
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CMDS*** option traces the commands executed by the multiplexer.
The ***CPU*** option traces words received from (control and write data)
and sent to (status and read data) the CPU. The ***BUF*** option traces
reads and writes from the internal channel buffers. The ***XFER***
option traces the characters sent and received from the multiplexer
channels. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and
data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>MPX cmds: \[OTx\] Command 037 parameter 100000 scheduled, time =
1250\
\>\>MPX cpu: \[Lix,C\] Status = 102000\
\>\>MPX buf: Port 2 character \'A\' get from read buffer \[73\]\
\>\>MPX xfer: Port 0 character LF transmitted\
\>\>MPX iobus: Received data 000000 with signals STF \| PRH

The multiplexer state contains these registers:

  ---------------------------- ------------ ------------- ---------------- -----------------------------------------
  ***Name***                   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Symbolic***   ***Action***

  ---------------------------- ------------ ------------- ---------------- -----------------------------------------

The RBUF and WBUF registers logically represent eight character buffers
of 514 bytes each, and the GET, SEP, and PUT registers logically
represent eight sets of two-word indexes. However, SCP supports only
one-dimensional register arrays, so they must be examined and deposited
as linear arrays of 4112 bytes and 16 words, respectively. So, for
example, RBUF \[0\] is byte 0 of buffer 0, RBUF \[513\] is byte 513 of
buffer 0, RBUF \[514\] is byte 0 of buffer 1, etc.

The IBUF and OBUF registers default to octal display but may be
displayed in single- or two-character formats by specifying the
***--A*** or ***--C*** switch, respectively. Symbolic entry for these
registers is also supported. The RBUF and WBUF registers default to
single-character format display and entry but may be overridden with
numeric-format switches, if desired.

12845B Line Printer Interface with One 2607/13/17/18 Line Printer
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The HP 12845B Line Printer Interface connects the HP 2607A (200 lines
per minute), HP 2613 (300 lpm), HP 2617 (600 lpm), and HP 2618 (1250
lpm) line printers to the HP computer family. The simulation provides
one printer unit; the 2607 is selected by default. Attaching a text file
to the unit simulates loading paper into the printer:

ATTACH {-N} LPT \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--N*** (new file) switch clears the contents of the image
file if present. Without the ***--N*** switch, printer output will be
appended to any preexisting image file content.

Printer output written to the image file is typically buffered by the
host operating system's underlying stream I/O routines. While it is
running, the simulator flushes the file after each printer top-of-form
request to permit convenient inspection of the image file. Stopping the
simulator also flushes the file.

If the host operating system returns an error when writing to the
printer image file, the simulator will report the error to the
simulation console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator printer I/O error: No space left on device

The printer goes offline with an alarm condition, and the simulator
stops. Simulation may then be resumed, either with the printer set back
online if the problem is fixed, or with the printer remaining offline if
the problem is uncorrectable.

Detaching the text file from the unit with the ***DETACH LPT*** command
simulates running out of paper. If the command is entered while there
are characters in the print buffer or, for the 2607 only, the print
location is not at the top of the form, **Command not completed** is
displayed on the simulation console, and the file remains attached until
the required conditions are true. Once simulation is resumed and the
print operations complete, the printer is set offline and detached
automatically.

Detaching may also be forced with the ***DETACH --F LPT*** command. This
simulates physically removing the paper and takes effect immediately,
regardless of any printing operations in progress.

Device and unit options include configuring the printer type and timing,
output format, vertical format unit (VFU), and the ability to set the
printer offline or online. The command forms are:

SET LPT \<device-option\>\
SET LPT \<unit-option\>

### Device Options

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **FASTTIME**           Use optimized timing; default
  **REALTIME**           Use realistic timing
  **PRINTER**            Install the standard printer VFU tape; default
  **DIAGNOSTIC**         Install the diagnostic VFU tape
  **SC=\<n\>**           Set the interface card select code; default is 15
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

The printer supports realistic and optimized timing modes. Realistic
timing attempts to model the print buffer load and print-and-space
operation delays inherent in the physical hardware. For example, output
of lines with more characters takes longer than output of lines with
fewer characters, and spacing six lines takes approximately six times
longer than spacing one line.

Optimized timing reduces operation delays to the minimums necessary to
operate correctly; this is much faster than a real line printer would
operate.

The delays used by the simulator in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set via
the register interface. The values may be adjusted as necessary to work
around any HP software problems that are triggered by the unusually
rapid print operations. Resetting the device with the ***RESET --P***
(power-on reset) command restores the original optimized times.

The ***DIAGNOSTIC*** option simulates the installation of the HP
02613-80002 or 02618-80002 diagnostic VFU tape. This is needed to run
the 2613/17/18 diagnostic (DSN 145103). Setting the ***PRINTER*** option
reinstalls the standard VFU tape (02607-80024 for the 2607 and
02613-80001 for the 2613, 2617, and 2618).

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  -------------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***        ***Action***
  **SHOW LPT**         Display the device and unit configuration
  **SHOW LPT MODES**   Display the timing and VFU tape modes
  -------------------- -------------------------------------------

### Unit Options

Unit options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **2607**               Set the printer model to 2607; default
  **2613**               Set the printer model to 2613
  **2617**               Set the printer model to 2617
  **2618**               Set the printer model to 2618
  **VFU**                Install the HP standard 66-line VFU tape; default
  **VFU=\<filename\>**   Install a custom VFU tape image
  **OFFLINE**            Set the printer offline; default when detached
  **ONLINE**             Set the printer online; default when attached
  **EXPAND**             Write expanded output to the printer image file; default
  **COMPACT**            Write compact output to the printer image file
  **POWEROFF**           Turn the printer power off
  **POWERON**            Turn the printer power on; default
  ---------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

The ***2607***, ***2613***, ***2617***, and ***2618*** options select
the printer model. Each printer is configured with Option 001, which
provides a 128-character set for the HP 2607 and 96-character sets for
the HP 2613, 2617, and 2618. The 2607 and 2618 support 132-character
print line lengths, while the 2613 and 2617 support 136-character lines.
Exceeding the line length causes an automatic print-and-space operation
on the 2607 and discards the extra characters on the 2613, 2617, and
2618.

The ***VFU*** option configures the printer's vertical format unit, as
described in the Vertical Format Unit section below.

The ***OFFLINE*** and ***ONLINE*** options place the printer offline and
online, respectively. The former provides a convenient method of setting
the printer \"down\" without detaching the associated output file.

The printer will not go offline if there are characters in the print
buffer. Instead, the offline condition is held off until the line is
printed and paper movement is complete. The ***SET LPT OFFLINE***
command checks for data in the print buffer or a print operation in
progress. If either condition is true, the action is deferred, and
**Command not completed** is displayed on the simulation console. A
***SHOW LPT*** command will show that the device is still online. Once
simulation is resumed and the print operation completes, the printer is
set offline. No console message reports this, although a subsequent
***SHOW LPT*** command will indicate the new status.

Entering a ***SET LPT ONLINE*** command while an offline or detach
action is deferred will cancel the action without triggering any
programmed offline-to-online status transition interrupt. A ***RESET
LPT*** command also cancels any deferred offline or detach action.
Additionally, it clears the print buffer and terminates any print action
in progress, so a ***SET LPT OFFLINE*** or ***DETACH LPT*** will succeed
if issued afterward.

The ***EXPAND*** and ***COMPACT*** options control the format of lines
written to the printer image file. In compact mode, a
carriage-return/line-feed character pair terminates a printed line, but
subsequent line spacing is performed by line-feed characters alone. A
top-of-form request will emit a form-feed character instead of the
number of line-feeds required to reach the top of the next form. This
mode is suitable for sending the printer output to a physical printer
connected to the host.

In expanded mode, paper advance is handled by emitting the correct
number of carriage-return/line-feed pairs. This mode is suitable for
retaining printer output as a text file.

The HP 2613, 2617, and 2618 printers are capable of overprinting. If the
printer is sent a format code to suppress spacing, the characters in the
buffer are printed and the buffer is emptied, but the paper is not
advanced. The next print operation will print its characters over those
already present on the paper. In simulation, overprinting is performed
in one of two ways, depending on the print mode.

In compact mode, overprinting is simulated by emitting a carriage-return
character at the end of the line. In expanded mode, overprinting is
simulated by merging characters in the buffer before writing them as a
single line in the printer image file. As the second and subsequent
lines are output, each new character is compared with its corresponding
character in the buffer. If the character in the buffer is a space, the
new character replaces it. If the new character is a space or is the
same as the character in the buffer, the character in the buffer is
retained. Otherwise, the character in the buffer is replaced with a
special character representing an overprinted combination. This
character defaults to DEL (octal 177) but may be changed by altering the
OVPCHR-register value.

The HP 2607 printer cannot overprint. A request to suppress spacing will
result in a single-line paper advance after printing.

Entering the ***SET LPT POWEROFF*** command simulates removing power
from the line printer. A ***SET LPT POWERON*** command restores power to
the printer.

### Vertical Format Unit

The HP 2607 supports an 8-channel vertical format unit (VFU), and the HP
2613, 2617, and 2618 printers support 12-channel VFUs. A continuous
punched paper tape that controls paper spacing is installed in the VFU
reader. The printer may be commanded to advance the paper until a
punched hole is detected in a specified VFU channel. The length of the
tape establishes the length of the forms loaded into the printer.

Initially, the standard VFU tape (part number 02607-80024 for the HP
2607 or 02613-80001 for the HP 2613, 2617, and 2618) is installed. This
tape associates commands for channels 1-8 with the following printer
actions:

  --------------- -------------------------------
  ***Channel***   ***Printer Advances to the***
  **1**           Top of form
  **2**           Bottom of form
  **3**           Next single space
  **4**           Next double space
  **5**           Next triple space
  **6**           Next half-page
  **7**           Next quarter-page
  **8**           Next sixth-page
  --------------- -------------------------------

For the 02613-80001 tape, channel 9 is punched the same as channel 2,
and channels 10-12 are uncommitted.

If the device is in diagnostic mode, the appropriate diagnostic VFU tape
(02613-80002 for the 2613 and 2617or 02618-80002 for the 2618) is
installed. These tapes associate commands for channels 1-8 as above and
for channels 9-12 with the following actions:

  --------------- --------------------------------
  ***Channel***   ***Printer Advances to the***
  **9**           Bottom of form
  **10**          Line before the bottom of form
  **11**          Line before the top of form
  **12**          Top of form
  --------------- --------------------------------

Setting the device back to printer mode restores the standard VFU tape.

The simulator supports the use of custom VFU tape images. A custom tape
may be installed in place of the standard tape by issuing the ***SET LPT
VFU=\<filename\>*** command. Custom tapes must reserve channel 1 for the
top-of-form location, but the other channels may be defined as desired.

A custom tape image is a plain-text file that starts with a VFU
definition line and then contains one channel-definition line for each
line of the form. The number of channel-definition lines establishes the
form length.

A semicolon appearing anywhere on a line begins a comment, and the
semicolon and all following characters are ignored. Zero-length lines,
including lines beginning with a semicolon, are ignored. Note that a
line containing one or more blanks is not a zero-length line, so, for
example, the line " *; a comment starting in column 2*" is not ignored.

The first (non-ignored) line in the file must be a VFU definition line
of this exact form:

VFU=\<punch characters\>,\<no-punch character\>{,\<title\>}

\...where:

-   ***punch characters*** is a set of one or more characters used
    > interchangeably to represent a punched location.

-   ***no-punch character*** is a single character representing a
    > non-punched location.

-   ***title*** is an optional description that is printed by the
    > ***SHOW LPT VFU*** command; the description "Custom VFU" is used
    > if the title is omitted.

If the ***VFU*** line is missing or not of the correct form, then
**Format error** is displayed on the simulation console, and the VFU
tape is not changed.

The remaining lines define the channels punched for each line of the
printed form. The line format consists of a sequence of punch, no-punch,
and "other" characters, in channel order. Each punch or no-punch
character defines a channel state, starting with channel 1 and
proceeding left-to-right until all channels for the VFU are defined; any
the extra channel states on the line are ignored. If the line terminates
before all channels are defined, the remaining channels are set to the
no-punch state. Any \"other\" characters, i.e., neither punch characters
nor no-punch characters, are ignored and may be used freely to delineate
the tape channels.

For a standard 66-line form, the first printable line (form line 1) is
paper line 4, and the last printable line (form line 60) is paper line
63. The first channel-definition line in the file specifies form line 1,
i.e., the top of the form, and must have a punch in channel 1. Channel
line 60 defines form line 60, i.e., the bottom of the form. Six more
channel lines follow: three for the bottom margin, and three for the top
margin of the next form.

An example custom VFU file using a 66-line tape definition for an
8-channel VFU is:

; the VFU definition\
;\
; the set of punch characters is "1" and "X"\
; the no-punch character is "0"\
; all other characters are ignored\
\
VFU=1X,0,A binary tape image\
\
; the channel definitions\
\
1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 ; top of form (line 1; must have a punch in channel 1)\
0-0-X-0-0-0-0-0 ; single space (line 2)\
0011 ; channels 5-8 default to no-punch (line 3)\
\[\...\]\
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 ; bottom of form (line 60)\
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; bottom form margin (line 61)\
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; bottom form margin (line 62)\
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; bottom form margin (line 63)\

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; top of form margin (line 65)\
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; top of form margin (line 66)

If a custom tape has been used, the standard tape may be reinstalled by
issuing the ***SET LPT VFU*** command.

Attempting to command an advance to a channel that is not punched will
cause a tape fault, and the printer will go offline. Setting the printer
back online will clear the fault.

The current VFU definition may be displayed with the following command:

  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------
  ***Command***      ***Action***
  **SHOW LPT VFU**   Display the currently loaded VFU tape definition
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------

This command displays the current VFU tape title and then the channel
definitions for each form line. By default, a punched channel is
indicated by an "O" character, and an unpunched channel is indicated by
a period ("."). These characters may be changed by depositing new values
into the PUNCHR and UNPCHR registers, respectively.

### Tracing and Registers

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CMD**        Printer commands executed
  **CSRW**       Interface control, status, read, and write actions
  **SERV**       Printer unit service events
  **XFER**       Data transmissions
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CMD*** option traces the commands executed by the printer. The
***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands sent
to the interface. The ***SERV*** option traces printer event service
entries. The ***XFER*** option traces the data words and format commands
written to the printer. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane
signals and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>LPT cmd: Printed 136 characters on line 1\
\>\>LPT cmd: Printer commanded to slew to VFU channel 3 from line 1\
\>\>LPT cmd: Printer advanced 1 line to line 2\
\>\>LPT csrw: Control is character \| \'\#\'\
\>\>LPT csrw: Status is online \| ready \| VFU 12 \| idle\
\>\>LPT serv: Unit delay 1577 service scheduled\
\>\>LPT serv: Printer service entered\
\>\>LPT xfer: Character \'G\' sent to printer\
\>\>LPT xfer: Format code 102 sent to printer\
\>\>LPT iobus: Received data 000000 with signals STC \| CLF \| SIR \|
PRH\
\>\>LPT iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals PRL

The Line Printer Controller state contains these registers:

  ---------------------- ------------ ------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------------------------------
  ***Name***             ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Symbolic***   ***Read-Only***   ***Description***

  **PTIME**              24           10                                               Fast printing delay time
  **STIME**              24           10                                               Fast paper slew per-line delay time

  ---------------------- ------------ ------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------------------------------

The PRTBUF, OVPCHR, PUNCHR, and UNPCHR registers default to
single-character format display and entry but may be overridden with
numeric-format switches, if desired. The OUTPUT register defaults to
octal display but may be displayed in single-character format by
specifying the ***--A*** switch. Symbolic entry for this register is
also supported.

The PFAULT and TFAULT registers indicate a paper fault and a tape fault,
respectively, when they contain the value 1. Attaching the printer will
clear a paper fault. Setting the printer online will clear a tape fault.

The character used to represent an overprinted position may be changed
by depositing a new value into the OVPCHR register. For example, the
***DEPOSIT LPT OVPCHR @*** command will change the character from the
default DEL (octal 177) to the commercial-at sign (octal 100).
Similarly, the characters used to represent punched and unpunched VFU
channels in the ***SHOW LPT VFU*** display may be changed by depositing
new values in the PUNCHR and UNPCHR registers, respectively.

The FORMLN register holds the current VFU form length, and the VFU
register array holds the content of the current VFU tape. The register
defaults to binary display, with channel 1 in the most-significant bit
and channel 8 or 12 in the least-significant bit, depending on the VFU
width. Elements 1-n correspond to VFU form lines 1-n, where a 1 value
indicates a punch, and a 0 value indicates a no-punch. Element 0 is the
logical OR of elements 1-n, so a 1 value indicates that the channel is
punched somewhere on the tape, and a 0 value indicates that the channel
is not punched.

12875A Processor Interconnect
-----------------------------

The HP 12875A Processor Interconnect kit is used to communicate between
the System Processor and the I/O Processor of a two-CPU HP 2000
Time-Shared BASIC system. It consists of four identical 12566A
Microcircuit Interfaces and two interconnecting cables. One pair of
interfaces is installed in adjacent I/O slots in each CPU, and the
cables are used to connect the higher-priority (lower select code)
interface in each computer to the lower-priority interface in the other
computer. This interconnection provides a full-duplex 16-bit parallel
communication channel between the processors. Each interface is actually
a bi-directional, half-duplex line that is used in the primary direction
for commands and in the reverse direction for status.

Two instances of the HP2100 simulator are run to simulate the SP and
IOP. Each simulator contains an Inbound Data interface assigned to the
lower-numbered select code, and an Outbound Data interface assigned to
the higher-numbered select code. The IPLI and IPLO devices,
respectively, simulate these interfaces, while the IPL device represents
the combination. A shared memory area simulates the interconnecting
cables.

The IPLI and IPLO devices are initially disabled. A ***SET IPL
ENABLED*** command will enable both devices. Attaching the IPL devices
of one machine to the IPL devices of the other simulates connecting the
cables. The System Processor instance establishes its connections with
this command:

ATTACH --S IPL \<code\>

\...where ***code*** is a user-selected decimal number between 1 and
65535 that uniquely identifies the instance pair to interconnect. The
I/O Processor instance establishes its connections with this command:

ATTACH --I IPL \<code\>

\...where ***code*** is the same decimal number specified in the System
Processor's ***ATTACH*** command.

The interface does not provide status to the CPU to indicate that the
interconnecting cables are disconnected. Attempting to send or receive
data with the cables not connected will cause the operation to hang, as
it will in hardware. Specifying the ***SET CPU STOP=IOERR*** command
will cause a simulation stop with a **Cable not connected** error if
this condition occurs. If the error is corrected by reattaching the
device, then resuming simulation will retry the operation.

Processor interconnect options that may be specified for the IPL device
are:

  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **WAIT**       Suspend execution until a signal is received from the other instance
  **SIGNAL**     Signal the other instance
  **SC=\<n\>**   Set the interface card select codes; defaults are 32/33
  **ENABLED**    Enable the IPLI and IPLO devices
  **DISABLED**   Disable the IPLI and IPLO devices; default
  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The ***WAIT*** and ***SIGNAL*** options are used to synchronize the two
simulator instances connected by ***ATTACH*** commands specifying the
same code number. Entering a ***SET IPL WAIT*** command suspends the
current simulator instance until a ***SET IPL SIGNAL*** command is
entered at the other simulator instance. If the signal is set before the
wait is requested, the current simulator instance will not suspend but
instead will return immediately to the SCP prompt. If either command is
entered before the IPL device has been attached, a **Command not
allowed** error is printed. The ***SET IPL WAIT*** command will wait
forever for the corresponding signal. To abort the wait manually and
return to the SCP prompt, enter CTRL+C.

When entering the ***SC*** option, specify the lower select code; the
higher select code will be set automatically, and the cards will be
assigned in the correct order.

Processor interconnect options that may be specified for either the IPLI
or IPLO device are:

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **DIAGNOSTIC**         Connect using the diagnostic test connector or cable
  **LINK**               Connect using the processor interconnect cables
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------

Enabling diagnostic mode for either device individually simulates the
installation of the HP 1251-0332 diagnostic test (loopback) connector in
place of the processor interconnect cable. This is needed to run the
General Purpose Register Diagnostic (DSN 143300) on that device.
Enabling diagnostic mode for both devices concurrently simulates the
connection of a processor interconnect cable between the two interfaces
within the same machine. With this connection, the HP 2100 Processor
Interconnect Cable Test (product number 24197) may be run. Entering the
***DIAGNOSTIC*** option automatically detaches any existing cable
connections. Attempting to attach a device in diagnostic mode will be
rejected with a **Command not allowed** error. Enabling link mode
removes the diagnostic connector or cable and permits the processor
interconnect cables to be installed with an ***ATTACH*** command.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured for
each card separately by specifying one or more of the reporting level
options:

  -------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CMD**        Command initiations and completions
  **CSRW**       Control, status, read, and write actions
  **PSERV**      Interface service scheduling calls and entries (periodic)
  **XFER**       Data receptions and transmissions
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- -----------------------------------------------------------

The ***CMD*** option traces the commands executed by the processor
interconnect. The ***CSRW*** option traces words received from and sent
to the CPU. The ***PSERV*** option traces event service scheduling and
entries, which occur at a periodic rate dependent on incoming data
availability. The ***XFER*** option traces the words received and
transmitted over the interconnecting cables. The ***IOBUS*** option
traces the I/O backplane signals and data received and returned via the
interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>IPLI cmd: Delaying DMA completion interrupt for 1 msec\
\>\>IPLI csrw: Command input word is 040000\
\>\>IPLI csrw: Status output word is 000103\
\>\>IPLI pserv: Poll delay 32 service scheduled\
\>\>IPLO pserv: Poll delay 50 service entered\
\>\>IPLI xfer: Word 000015 sent to link\
\>\>IPLI xfer: Word 000040 delta 63 received from link\
\>\>IPLI iobus: Received data 000000 with signals IOO \| STC \| CLC \|
CLF \| EDT \| SIR\
\>\>IPLI iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals (none)

The interface supports the ***LOAD IPL*** and ***BOOT IPL*** commands to
load an absolute binary program into memory from the other processor.
Depending on the current CPU model, the ***LOAD*** command copies either
the Basic Binary Loader for the I/O Processor (BBL-IOP) or the 12992K
boot loader ROM into memory, configures it for the interface's select
code, and sets the P register to the loader's starting address. The
***BOOT*** command performs these same actions and then presets the
system and begins execution.

For a 2100/14/15/16 CPU containing a previously configured BBL-IOP in
memory, the commands are equivalent in hardware to setting the P
register to the starting address, pressing the LOADER ENABLE button on
the front panel, and, for the ***BOOT*** command, pressing the INTERNAL
PRESET, EXTERNAL PRESET, and RUN buttons to begin execution. The S
register value is not relevant for this loader.

The BBL-IOP is a dual-purpose loader that also permits loading an
absolute binary program from the paper tape reader. When the loader is
copied into memory, the processor interconnect portion is configured for
the select code of the Inbound Data interface, and the paper tape
portion is configured for the select code of the paper tape reader
interface. The P register is automatically set to the starting address
of the processor interconnect portion, which starts at x7750 (i.e.,
offset 1750 within the highest page in memory). To execute the paper
tape portion, the P register may be reset to x7700 (offset 1700).

For a 1000 M/E/F-Series CPU, the commands are equivalent in hardware to
setting the S register to select and configure the HP 12992K boot loader
ROM, pressing the IBL button to copy the ROM into memory, and, for the
***BOOT*** command, pressing the PRESET and RUN buttons to begin
execution. The S register is preset as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ------------------ ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***           ***10***   ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***
  0          0          0          0          IPLI select code   0          0         0         0         0         0                                                 
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ------------------ ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

For either loader, execution ends with one of the following halt
instructions:

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the calculated value, B =
    > the tape value.

-   HLT 55 --- the program load address would overlay the loader.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of the program was reached with a successful
    > read.

The IPLI and IPLO state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- ----------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Action***
  **IBUF**     16           8             Input buffer
  **OBUF**     16           8             Output buffer
  **CTL**      1            2             Control flip-flop
  **FLG**      1            2             Flag flip-flop
  **FBF**      1            2             Flag buffer flip-flop
  **TIME**     24           10            Polling interval for input
  ------------ ------------ ------------- ----------------------------

12920A Asynchronous Multiplexer Interface
-----------------------------------------

The HP 12920A Asynchronous Multiplexer Interface is a 16-channel
terminal multiplexer commonly used with the HP 2000 series of
Time-Shared BASIC systems. It connects from 1 to 16 serial terminals or
modems at programmable baud rates from 75 to 2400 bits per second.
Character sizes are also programmable from 5 to 12 bits in length,
including the start and stop bits. Each channel can be independently
configured for separate send and receive rates. The multiplexer is not
buffered, so the CPU has to retrieve each character from a given channel
before the next character arrives. To avoid saturating the CPU with
interrupt requests, the multiplexer maintains an internal
\"mini-interrupt\" system that queues requests and holds additional
interrupts off until the CPU acknowledges the current request.

The 12920A consists of two Printed Circuit Assemblies --- a Lower Data
PCA and an Upper Data PCA --- and an optional Control PCA. In
simulation, the multiplexer is implemented as a three-device set, as
follows:

-   MUXL --- the Lower Data PCA

-   MUX --- the Upper Data PCA

-   MUXC --- the Control PCA

The Data PCAs provide the serial data line connections for terminals and
data sets. Five additional receive-only auxiliary channels may be
connected as a group under software control to one of the sixteen main
channels to detect the incoming baud rate. The Control PCA provides
serial control and status lines for Bell 103 data sets.

The Lower and Upper Data PCAs must be in adjacent I/O slots. The Control
PCA may be placed in any slot, although in practice it was placed in the
slot above the Upper Data PCA, so that all three PCAs were physically
together.

The 12920A supported one or two Control PCAs (two were used with
801-type automatic dialers). Under simulation, only one Control PCA is
supported.

### Lower and Upper Data PCAs

The Data PCAs provide the Transmitted Data (BA) and Received Data (BB)
lines for up to sixteen terminals. They perform input and output through
Telnet sessions connected to a user-specified port or through
individually specified host serial ports. The Data PCAs support
concurrent Telnet and serial connections. The ***ATTACH*** command
specifies the local port to be used for Telnet connections:

ATTACH MUX \<port\>

\...where ***port*** is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not
being used for other TCP/IP activities. When the Upper Data PCA is
attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens for
connections on the specified port and assigns them to channels in
ascending numeric order, unless an alternate connection order has been
specified.

The ***ATTACH*** command is also used to specify the host serial port
for individual multiplexer channels:

ATTACH {--V} MUX
LINE=\<chan\>,CONNECT=\<name\>{;\<rate\>-\<size\>\<parity\>\<stopbits\>}

\...where ***chan*** is the multiplexer channel number from 0-15, and
***name*** is the host name of the serial port to use (e.g., *ser0* or
*COM1*). If the ***--V*** (verbose) option is included, a connection
confirmation message will be output to the port.

An optional serial port configuration string may be supplied after the
host name. The required values are:

-   ***rate*** is the baud rate in bits per second.

-   ***size*** is the character size in bits including the parity bit,
    > if designated.

-   ***parity*** designates the parity to use: *N* (no), *E* (even), *O*
    > (odd), *M* (mark), or *S* (space).

-   ***stopbits*** is the number of stop bits (*1*, *1.5*, or *2*).

Host serial connections default to 9600 baud, 8-bit characters, no
parity, and one stop bit.

Upper and Lower Data PCA configuration options are available for the
device and for the individual units. The command forms are:

SET MUX \<device-option\>\
SET MUXL \<device-option\>\
SET MUXLn \<unit-option\>

Device options that may be specified for the Upper Data PCA are:

  ------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***                          ***Action***
  **TERMINAL**                          Connect using Telnet or serial ports; default
  **DIAGNOSTIC**                        Connect using diagnostic test cables
  **LINEORDER=\<c1\>\[;\<c2\>\...\]**   Set the channel connection order
  **DISCONNECT=\<chan\>**               Disconnect the specified channel
  **SC=\<n\>**                          Set the interface card select codes; default is 40/41
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**                  Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**                           Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**                           Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**                          Disable the device
  ------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------

Enabling the ***DIAGNOSTIC*** mode simulates the installation of eight
HP 30062-60003 diagnostic test (loopback) cables between channels 0-1,
2-3, etc., as required by the multiplexer diagnostic. Each cable
connects the Transmitted Data, Data Terminal Ready, and Request to Send
lines, respectively, of one channel to the Received Data, Data Set
Ready, and Carrier Detect lines of the other channel, and vice versa. In
addition, all sessions are disconnected, and the multiplexer is detached
from the Telnet listening port. While in diagnostic mode, the ***ATTACH
MUX*** command is not allowed. Enabling ***TERMINAL*** mode allows the
multiplexer to be attached to accept incoming connections again.

The ***LINEORDER*** option specifies the order in which connections are
assigned to multiplexer channels. The arguments may be single channel
numbers or ranges of channel numbers of the form ***m-n***. Telnet
connections to the listening port will be assigned to multiplexer
channels in the sequence specified. In the absence of a ***SET MUX
LINEORDER*** command, connections will be assigned by default in
ascending channel order. The default order may be reestablished by
specifying the command ***SET MUX LINEORDER=ALL***.

A channel may be manually disconnected from its associated Telnet
session with the ***SET MUX DISCONNECT=\<chan\>*** command. Otherwise,
the connection will remain open until disconnected either by the Telnet
client or a ***DETACH MUX*** command, unless the channel is controlled
by the Control PCA. For a serial connection, the command will drop and
then raise the Data Terminal Ready line; to disconnect the serial port,
include the ***--C*** switch in the command.

When entering the ***SC*** option, specify the lower select code with
either device name; the higher select code will be set automatically,
and the cards will be assigned in the correct order.

Device options that may be specified for the Lower Data PCA are:

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **SC=\<n\>**           Set the interface card select codes; default is 40/41
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------

Unit options that may be specified for individual Lower Data PCA
channels are:

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **UC**                 Upshift lowercase output characters to uppercase; default
  **7B**                 Output with high-order bit cleared
  **7P**                 Output with high-order bit cleared, non-printing suppressed
  **8B**                 Output characters without changing
  **DATASET**            Enable modem control via the Control PCA
  **NODATASET**          Disable modem control; default
  **LOG=\<filename\>**   Enable I/O logging
  **NOLOG**              Disable I/O logging; default
  **DISCONNECT**         Disconnect the channel
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

Each channel may be set to one of four output modes (***UC***, ***7B***,
***7P***, or ***8B***). The default mode is ***UC*** for all channels.
If the multiplexer is used with RTE driver DVS00 and logical driver
LDV05, or DOS driver DVR73 and logical drivers PMT01 or PMT02, the mode
must be changed to ***7B*** or ***8B*** to allow ESC, DC1, and ENQ
characters to pass through to the terminal. Alternatively, the ***SET
CONSOLE PCHAR*** SCP command may be used to redefine the set of
printable characters. Modes ***UC*** and ***7P*** are compatible with
DVS00 and DVR73 using the default logical driver.

The ***DATASET*** option enables modem control via the corresponding
channel on the Control PCA. When modem control is enabled, a connected
channel that has Data Terminal Ready (command bit C1) high will set
Carrier Detect (status bit S2) in the line status, and a programmed drop
of the DTR line will disconnect the Telnet session. Setting the
***NODATASET*** option causes DTR transitions to be ignored.

Each channel supports independent I/O logging to a file. Disabling
logging also closes the log file.

A channel may be manually disconnected from its associated Telnet
session with the ***SET MUXLn DISCONNECT*** command. Otherwise, the
connection will remain open until disconnected either by the Telnet
client or a ***DETACH MUX*** command, unless the channel is controlled
by the Control PCA. For a serial connection, the command will drop and
then raise the Data Terminal Ready line; to disconnect the serial port,
include the ***--C*** switch in the command.

Upper Data PCA device configuration may be displayed with the following
commands:

  -------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Command***              ***Action***
  **SHOW MUX**               Display the device configuration
  **SHOW MUX LINEORDER**     Display the channel connection order
  **SHOW MUX CONNECTIONS**   Display the channel connections
  **SHOW MUX STATISTICS**    Display the channel I/O statistics for the active connections
  -------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

Lower Data PCA unit configuration may be displayed with the following
commands:

  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------
  ***Command***            ***Action***
  **SHOW MUXL\<n\>**       Display the selected channel's configuration
  **SHOW MUXL\<n\> LOG**   Display the selected channel's logging status
  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------

In addition to the current configuration settings, a channel controlled
by the Control PCA will be marked **data set** in the listing; a channel
not controlled will be marked **direct**.

When a debug log has been established, tracing of the Upper Data PCA
device may be configured by specifying one or more of these reporting
level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CSRW**       Control, status, read, and write actions
  **PSERV**      Poll unit service events (periodic)
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

Tracing of the Lower Data PCA device may be configured by specifying
these options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CSRW**       Control, status, read, and write actions
  **SERV**       Channel unit service events
  **XFER**       Data receptions and transmissions
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands
sent to the interface. The ***PSERV*** option traces poll unit service
scheduling and entries. The poll service is entered once every 10
milliseconds to poll for new Telnet or serial connections and for input
characters to be received by the active channels. The ***SERV*** option
traces channel output service scheduling and entries. The ***XFER***
option traces the words received and transmitted via the multiplexer
channels. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and
data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>MUX csrw: Channel 0 is selected\
\>\>MUX csrw: Status is channel 0 \| receive\
\>\>MUXL csrw: Parameter is send \| enable parity/echo \| 11 bits \| 110
baud\

  ------------------- ------------ ------------- ---------------- --------------------------------------------------

The RBUF and XBUF registers default to single-character format display
and entry but may be overridden with numeric-format switches, if
desired.

### Control PCA

The Control PCA provides the Request to Send (CA) and Data Terminal
Ready (CD) control lines, and the Data Set Ready (CC) and Carrier Detect
(CF) status lines for each of sixteen terminals or data sets. The modem
controls model the Bell 103A data set without ring detection.

A new Telnet connection sets Data Set Ready and is established whether
Data Terminal Ready is set or not.

Control PCA device options that may be specified are:

  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **SC=\<n\>**   Set the interface card select code; default is 42
  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------

The Control PCA is usually installed in the slot above the Upper Data
PCA, but this is not required.

There are no Control PCA units or unit commands.

Control PCA device configuration may be displayed with the following
commands:

  --------------- ----------------------------------
  ***Command***   ***Action***
  **SHOW MUXC**   Display the device configuration
  --------------- ----------------------------------

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CSRW**       Control, status, read, and write actions
  **XFER**       Control and status line changes
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The CSRW option traces control, status, read, and write commands sent to
the interface. The XFER option traces the changes in control and status
lines by the active channels. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O
backplane signals and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>MUXC csrw: Status is channel 0 \| I2 \| I1 \| ES2 \| ES1 \| \~S2 \|
\~S1\
\>\>MUXC csrw: Control is channel 0 \| update \| \~C2 \| \~C1 \| ES2 \|

\>\>MUXC csrw: Channel 1 interrupt requested\
\>\>MUXC xfer: Channel 0 connected\
\>\>MUXC xfer: Channel 0 line status is RTS \| DTR\
\>\>MUXC xfer: Channel 0 disconnect dropped DCD and DSR\
\>\>MUXC iobus: Received data 031374 with signals IOO\
\>\>MUXC iobus: Returned data 141414 with signals (none)

12966A Buffered Asynchronous Communications Interface
-----------------------------------------------------

The 12966A Buffered Asynchronous Communications Interface card
supplanted the 12531C Teletype and 12880A CRT interfaces as the primary
terminal connection for HP computer systems. The main advantage of this
card over the others was its 128-character FIFO memory. While this
allowed more efficient I/O than its interrupt-per-character
predecessors, the most significant improvement was that block input from
the 264x-series of CRT terminals was supported. The 264x were the first
HP-supported terminals to provide local editing and character storage,
as well as mass storage via dual DC-100 minicartridge drives. This
support meant that input from the terminal could come in bursts at the
full baud rate, which would overrun the older cards that needed a small
intercharacter handling time. The older cards also placed a substantial
load on the CPU in high-baud-rate output applications.

The BACI simulator performs input and output through a Telnet session
connected to a user-specified port or through a specified host serial
port. The ***ATTACH*** command specifies the local port to be used for
Telnet connections:

ATTACH BACI \<port\>

\...where ***port*** is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not
being used for other TCP/IP activities. When the BACI is attached and
the simulator is running, the BACI listens for connections on the
specified port. Only one connection at a time is permitted.

The ***ATTACH*** command is also used to specify a host port for serial
connections:

ATTACH {--V} BACI
CONNECT=\<name\>{;\<rate\>-\<size\>\<parity\>\<stopbits\>}

\...where ***name*** is the host name of the serial port to use (e.g.,
*ser0* or *COM1*). If the ***--V*** (verbose) option is included, a
connection confirmation message will be output to the port.

An optional serial port configuration string may be supplied after the
host name. The required values are:

-   ***rate*** is the baud rate in bits per second.

-   ***size*** is the character size in bits including the parity bit,
    > if designated.

-   ***parity*** designates the parity to use: *N* (no), *E* (even), *O*
    > (odd), *M* (mark), or *S* (space).

-   ***stopbits*** is the number of stop bits (*1*, *1.5*, or *2*).

Serial connections default to 9600 baud, 8-bit characters, no parity,
and one stop bit.

While the BACI can connect to generic clients, RTE drivers for the BACI
require the use of HP terminals or terminal emulators.

Device and unit configuration options specify timing and output modes.
The command forms are:

SET BACI \<device-option\>\
SET BACI \<unit-option\>

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **DIAGNOSTIC**         Connect using a diagnostic test connector
  **TERMINAL**           Connect using Telnet or a serial port; default
  **FASTTIME**           Use optimized timing; default
  **REALTIME**           Use realistic timing
  **SC=\<n\>**           Set the interface card select code; default is 35
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

Enabling ***DIAGNOSTIC*** mode simulates the installation of the HP
12966-60003 diagnostic test (loopback) connector onto the 12966A card.
In addition, any current session is disconnected, and the BACI is
detached from the Telnet listening port. While in diagnostic mode, the
***ATTACH BACI*** command is not allowed. Enabling ***TERMINAL*** mode
simulates the installation of the HP 12966-60008 (264x terminal)
connector and RS-232 cable and allows the BACI to be attached to accept
an incoming connection again.

The BACI supports fifteen programmable baud rates from 50 to 9600 baud,
as well as an external rate determined by the connected terminal. With
the ***REALTIME*** option, the simulation accurately models the
transmission and reception baud rates (in machine instructions). For
example, setting the interface to 1200 baud will take twice as long to
output a given listing as setting the interface to 2400 baud. Enabling
optimized timing with the ***FASTTIME*** option reduces the timing to
the minimum necessary to operate correctly; this is much faster than the
real BACI would operate.

Setting the BACI to fast timing also enables three optimizations. First,
buffered characters are transferred via Telnet in blocks, rather than a
character at a time. Second, ENQ/ACK handshaking is done locally,
without involving the Telnet client. Third, reception of characters
entered during output operations is delayed until after the first
ENQ/ACK handshake at the end of the line; this significantly improves
break-mode response under RTE.

Unit options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **CAPSLOCK**           Upshift lowercase input characters to uppercase
  **NOCAPSLOCK**         Input characters are unchanged; default
  **LOG=\<filename\>**   Enable I/O logging
  **NOLOG**              Disable I/O logging; default
  **DISCONNECT**         Disconnect the connection
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------

Many HP operating systems require command input in upper case, although
mixed-case output is supported. As an aid to avoid toggling the host
keyboard in and out of CAPS LOCK mode, the BACI provides this function
locally. The default mode is ***NOCAPSLOCK***.

The BACI supports I/O logging to a file. Disabling logging also closes
the log file.

The BACI may be manually disconnected from its associated Telnet session
with the ***SET BACI DISCONNECT*** command. Otherwise, the connection
will remain open until disconnected either by the Telnet client or a
***DETACH BACI*** command. For a serial connection, the command will
drop and then raise the Data Terminal Ready line; to disconnect the
serial port, include the ***--C*** switch in the command.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  -------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Command***              ***Action***
  **SHOW BACI**              Display the device and unit configuration
  **SHOW BACI CONNECTION**   Display the active connection status
  **SHOW BACI STATISTICS**   Display the I/O statistics for the active connection
  -------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CMDS**       Command initiations and completions
  **CPU**        Words received from and sent to the CPU
  **BUF**        Data read from and written to the FIFO
  **XFER**       Data receptions and transmissions
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CMDS*** option traces the commands executed by the interface. The
***CPU*** option traces words received from (control and write data) and
sent to (status and read data) the CPU. The ***BUF*** option traces gets
from and puts to the internal FIFO buffers. The ***XFER*** option traces
the words received and transmitted via the Telnet or serial connection.
The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and data
received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>BACI cmds: \[STF\] Flag, SRQ, and lockout set\
\>\>BACI cpu: \[Lix,C\] Received data = 102042\
\>\>BACI buf: Character LF put to FIFO \[29\], character counter = 53\
\>\>BACI xfer: Character \'R\' transmitted from the UART\
\>\>BACI iobus: Received data 000000 with signals STF \| SIR\
\>\>BACI iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals (none)

The FIFO register defaults to single-character format display and entry
but may be overridden with a numeric-format switch, if desired. The
other symbolic registers default to octal display but may be displayed
in single-character format by specifying the ***--A*** switch. Symbolic
entry for these registers is also supported

Disc I/O Device Simulations
===========================

The simulator provides these disc interfaces and their associated
peripherals:

12557A Cartridge Disc Interface with Four 2870 Drives, 13210A Disc Drive Interface with Four 7900 Drives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 12557A Cartridge Disc Interface connects from one to four HP 2870A
(2.5 MB) disc drives to the HP computer family. The 13210A Disc Drive
Interface connects from one to four HP 7900A (5.0 MB) disc drives. Both
interfaces consist of two Printed Circuit Assemblies installed in
adjacent I/O slots. The Data PCA is assigned the higher-priority (lower
numbered) select code, and the Control PCA is assigned the
lower-priority select code. The DPD and DPC devices simulate these PCAs.

Attaching a disc image file to a unit simulates inserting a disc pack
into a drive:

ATTACH {-R \| -N} DPCn \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch is equivalent to setting the
drive's Upper and Lower Data Protect switches to the *On* position.
Adding the ***--N*** (new file) switch creates a full-size image file,
equivalent to formatting the new disc before use.

If the host operating system returns an error when reading or writing a
disc image file, the simulator will report the error to the simulation
console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator DP disc I/O error: No space left on device

\...and the simulation will stop with an **I/O Error** message. No error
recovery is attempted.

A drive's unit number is not set explicitly. Instead, the drive unit
number is derived from the simulation unit number. For example, unit
DPC0 responds to drive select number 0. Changing the drive select
jumpers on a mounted drive is simulated by detaching and reattaching the
disc image file to the corresponding simulation unit.

Device and unit options include configuring the interface and drive
type, protection and format status, and the ability to set drives ready
or not-ready. The command forms are:

SET DPC \<device-option\>\
SET DPCn \<unit-option\>

Device options that may be specified are:

  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **12557A**     Use the 12557A interface and 2870A drives
  **13210A**     Use the 13210A interface and 7900A drives; default
  **SC=\<n\>**   Set the interface card select codes; default is 22/23
  **ENABLED**    Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**   Disable the device
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------

The ***12557A*** and ***13210A*** options set the interface type and, by
implication, the disc drive type.

When entering the ***SC*** option, specify the lower select code with
either device name; the higher select code will be set automatically,
and the cards will be assigned in the correct order.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  ------------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***       ***Action***
  **SHOW DPC**        Display the device and unit configuration
  **SHOW DPC TYPE**   Display the interface type
  ------------------- -------------------------------------------

Unit options that may be specified for the individual disc drives are:

  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***    ***Action***
  **UNLOAD**      Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Stop*; default when detached
  **LOAD**        Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Run*; default when attached
  **PROTECT**     Set the drive's Data Protect switches to *On*
  **UNPROTECT**   Set the drive's Data Protect switches to *Off*; default
  **ENABLED**     Enable the unit; default
  **DISABLED**    Disable the unit
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------

The ***UNLOAD*** and ***LOAD*** options unload and load the drive\'s
heads from the disc pack, setting the drive not-ready and ready,
respectively. ***UNLOAD*** provides a convenient method of setting a
drive \"down\" without detaching the associated disc image file.

The ***PROTECT*** option prevents writing to the disc. It is the
hardware equivalent of setting the Upper and Lower Data Protect switches
to the *On* position. The ***UNPROTECT*** option permits writing and is
equivalent to setting the switches to *Off*. Separate protection for the
upper and lower platters of the 7900 drive is not supported. Also, the
drive Protect/Override switch is not supported; drive protection is
permanently overridden.

The interface supports the ***LOAD {--R} DPC*** and ***BOOT{--R} DPC***
commands to load a disc boot extension into memory. Depending on the
current CPU model, the ***LOAD*** command copies either the Basic
Moving-Head Disc Loader (BMDL-7900) or the 12992F boot loader ROM into
memory, configures it for the Data interface's select code, and sets the
P register to the loader's starting address. The ***BOOT*** command
performs these same actions and then presets the system and begins
execution. For either command, if the ***--R*** switch is specified, the
boot extension will be read from the removable platter. If ***--R*** is
not specified, then the boot extension will be read from the fixed
platter.

For a 2100/14/15/16 CPU containing a previously configured BMDL in
memory, the commands are equivalent in hardware to setting the P
register to the starting address, pressing the LOADER ENABLE button on
the front panel, and, for the ***BOOT*** command, pressing the INTERNAL
PRESET, EXTERNAL PRESET, and RUN buttons to begin execution. The S
register value is not relevant for this loader.

The BMDL is a dual-purpose loader that also permits loading an absolute
binary program from the paper tape reader. When the loader is copied
into memory, the disc portion is configured for the select code of the
Data interface, and the paper tape portion is configured for the select
code of the paper tape reader interface. The P register is automatically
set to the starting address of the disc portion, which starts at x7750
(i.e., offset 1750 within the highest page in memory). The loader reads
6144 words (for the 7900A) or 3027 words (for the 2870A) from cylinder 0
sector 0 of the specified subchannel into memory starting at location
2011 octal. Loader execution ends with the following instruction:

-   JSB 2055,I --- the disc read completed.

Normal completion status is End of Cylinder and Any Error (000041
octal).

To execute the paper tape portion, the P register may be reset to x7700
(offset 1700). Loader execution ends with one of the following halt
instructions:

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the tape value, B = the
    > calculated value.

-   HLT 55 --- the program load address would overlay the loader.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of tape was reached with a successful read.

For a 1000 M/E/F-Series CPU, the commands are equivalent in hardware to
setting the S register to select and configure the HP 12992F boot loader
ROM, pressing the IBL button to copy the ROM into memory, and, for the
***BOOT*** command, pressing the PRESET and RUN buttons to begin
execution. The S register is preset as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***          ***10***    ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***
  0          0          0          0          DPD select code   unchanged   0         0                                                                              
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

If the ***--R*** switch is specified, bit 0 is set to 1 to boot from the
removable platter. If ***--R*** is not specified, then bit 0 is set to 0
to boot from the fixed platter. Bits 5-3 of the existing S-register
value are retained when the loader is executed and are available to the
boot extension program.

The loader reads 6144 words from cylinder 0 sector 0 of the specified
subchannel into memory starting at location 2011 octal. Loader execution
ends with one of the following instructions:

-   HLT 30 --- a drive fault occurred; enter the ***GO*** command to
    > retry.

-   JSB 2055,I --- the disc read succeeded.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured for
each card separately by specifying the reporting level option:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and data
received and returned by the interface.

The Data PCA state contains these registers:

12565A Disc Interface with Two 2883 Drives
------------------------------------------

The 12565A Disc Interface connects one or two HP 2883A (23 MB) disc
drives to the HP computer family. The interface consists of two Printed
Circuit Assemblies installed in adjacent I/O slots. The Data PCA is
assigned the higher-priority (lower numbered) select code, and the
Control PCA is assigned the lower-priority select code. The DQD and DQC
devices simulate these PCAs.

Attaching a disc image file to a unit simulates inserting a disc pack
into a drive:

ATTACH {-R \| -N} DQCn \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch prevents writing to the disc
image. Adding the ***--N*** (new file) switch creates a full-size image
file, equivalent to formatting the new disc before use.

If the host operating system returns an error when reading or writing a
disc image file, the simulator will report the error to the simulation
console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator DQ disc I/O error: No space left on device

\...and the simulation will stop with an **I/O Error** message. No error
recovery is attempted.

A drive's unit number is not set explicitly. Instead, the drive unit
number is derived from the simulation unit number. For example, unit
DQC0 responds to drive select number 0. Changing the drive select
jumpers on a mounted drive is simulated by detaching and reattaching the
disc image file to the corresponding simulation unit.

Device and unit options include configuring the protection and
drive-ready status. The command forms are:

SET DQC \<device-option\>\
SET DQCn \<unit-option\>

Device options that may be specified are:

  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **SC=\<n\>**   Set the interface card select codes; default is 24/25
  **ENABLED**    Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**   Disable the device
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------

When entering the ***SC*** option, specify the lower select code with
either device name; the higher select code will be set automatically,
and the cards will be assigned in the correct order.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following command:

  --------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***   ***Action***
  **SHOW DQC**    Display the device and unit configuration
  --------------- -------------------------------------------

Unit options that may be specified for individual disc drives are:

  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***    ***Action***
  **UNLOAD**      Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Stop*; default when detached
  **LOAD**        Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Run*; default when attached
  **PROTECT**     Prohibit writing to the drive
  **UNPROTECT**   Permit writing to the drive; default
  **ENABLED**     Enable the unit; default
  **DISABLED**    Disable the unit
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------

The ***UNLOAD*** and ***LOAD*** options unload and load the drive\'s
heads from the disc pack, setting the drive not-ready and ready,
respectively. ***UNLOAD*** provides a convenient method of setting a
drive \"down\" without detaching the associated disc image file.

The ***PROTECT*** option prevents writing to the disc, and the
***UNPROTECT*** option permits writing. These options have no hardware
analog; writing is always permitted on the 2883A. Also, the drive Format
switch is not supported; drive address protection is permanently
overridden.

The interface supports the ***LOAD DQC*** and ***BOOT DQC*** commands to
load a disc boot extension into memory. Depending on the current CPU
model, the ***LOAD*** command copies either the Basic Moving-Head Disc
Loader (BMDL-2883) or the 12992A boot loader ROM into memory, configures
it for the Data interface's select code, and sets the P register to the
loader's starting address. The ***BOOT*** command performs these same
actions and then presets the system and begins execution.

For a 2100/14/15/16 CPU containing a previously configured BMDL in
memory, the commands are equivalent in hardware to setting the P
register to the starting address, pressing the LOADER ENABLE button on
the front panel, and, for the ***BOOT*** command, pressing the INTERNAL
PRESET, EXTERNAL PRESET, and RUN buttons to begin execution. The S
register value is not relevant for this loader.

The BMDL is a dual-purpose loader that also permits loading an absolute
binary program from the paper tape reader. When the loader is copied
into memory, the disc portion is configured for the select code of the
Data interface, and the paper tape portion is configured for the select
code of the paper tape reader interface. The P register is automatically
set to the starting address of the disc portion, which starts at x7750
(i.e., offset 1750 within the highest page in memory). The loader reads
128 words from cylinder 0 head 0 sector 0 into memory starting at
location 2011 octal. Loader execution ends with the following
instruction:

-   JMP 2055,I --- the disc read completed.

To execute the paper tape portion, the P register may be reset to x7700
(offset 1700). Loader execution ends with one of the following halt
instructions:

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the tape value, B = the
    > calculated value.

-   HLT 55 --- the program load address would overlay the loader.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of tape was reached with a successful read.

For a 1000 M/E/F-Series CPU, the commands are equivalent in hardware to
setting the S register to select and configure the HP 12992A boot loader
ROM, pressing the IBL button to copy the ROM into memory, and, for the
***BOOT*** command, pressing the PRESET and RUN buttons to begin

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***          ***10***    ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

Bits 5-3 of the existing S-register value are retained when the loader
is executed and are available to the boot extension program.

The loader reads 128 words from cylinder 0 head 0 sector 0 into memory
starting at location 2011 octal. Loader execution ends with the
following instruction:

-   JSB 2055,I --- the disc read completed.

The success or failure of the transfer is not checked.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured for
each card separately by specifying the reporting level option:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned

12606B Disc Memory Interface with One 2770/2771 Disc, 12610B Drum Memory Interface with One 2773/2774/2775 Drum
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 12606B Disc Memory Interface connects one HP 2770A or 2771A
fixed-head disc drive to the HP computer family. The 12610B Drum Memory
Interface connects one HP 2773A 2774A, or 2775A fixed-head drum drive.
Both interfaces consist of two Printed Circuit Assemblies installed in
adjacent I/O slots. The Data PCA is assigned the higher-priority (lower
numbered) select code, and the Control PCA is assigned the
lower-priority select code. The DRD and DRC devices simulate these PCAs.

The storage capacity of the HP 277x drives is expandable by adding sets
of heads to the base model. This simulation supports the following
models and options:

  -------------------- -------------- --------------- ------------- ----------------
  ***Model-Option***   ***Tracks***   ***Sectors***   ***Words***   ***Capacity***
  **2770A**            32             90              64            180 KW
  **2771A**            64             90              64            360 KW
  **2771A-001**        128            90              64            720 KW

  **2773A-001**        256            32              64            512 KW
  **2773A-002**        320            32              64            640 KW
  **2774A**            384            32              64            768 KW

  **2774A-002**        512            32              64            1024 KW
  **2775A**            768            32              64            1536 KW
  -------------------- -------------- --------------- ------------- ----------------

Attaching a disc or drum image file to a unit simulates applying power
to the drive:

ATTACH {-R \| -N} DRC \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch is equivalent to removing all of
the track-protection diodes and setting the Data PCA Track Protect
switch to the *On* position. Adding the ***--N*** (new file) switch
creates a full-size image file, equivalent to formatting the new disc or
drum before use.

This device buffers the image file in memory, and the file is not
written until the unit is detached. If the host operating system returns
an error when writing the file, the simulator will report the error to
the simulation console, e.g.:

HP 2100: I/O error - No space left on device

No error recovery is attempted.

Device and unit options include configuring the drive type and track
protection. The command forms are:

SET DRC \<device-option\>\
SET DRC \<unit-option\>

Device options that may be specified are:

  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Action***
  **SC=\<n\>**   Set the interface card select codes; default is 26/27
  **ENABLED**    Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**   Disable the device
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------

When entering the ***SC*** option, specify the lower select code with
either device name; the higher select code will be set automatically,
and the cards will be assigned in the correct order.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following command:

  --------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***   ***Action***
  **SHOW DRC**    Display the device and unit configuration
  --------------- -------------------------------------------

Unit options that may be specified are:

  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***          ***Action***
  **180K**              Use the 12606B interface and 2770A drive
  **360K**              Use the 12606B interface and 2771A drive
  **720K**              Use the 12606B interface and 2771A-001 drive

  **1024K**             Use the 12610B interface and 2774A-002 drive
  **1536K**             Use the 12610B interface and 2775A drive
  **PROTECT**           Prohibit writing to the protected tracks
  **UNPROTECT**         Permit writing to all tracks; default
  **TRACKPROT=\<n\>**   Set the number of protected tracks; default is 1
  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------

The ***180K***, ***360K***, and ***720K*** options set the interface
type and drive model for the fixed-head disc. The ***384K***,
***512K***, ***640K***, ***768K***, ***896K***, ***1024K***, and
***1536K*** set the interface type and drive model for the fixed-head
drum.

The ***PROTECT*** option prevents writing to the tracks that have been
configured as protected, and the ***UNPROTECT*** option permits writing
to all tracks.

The ***TRACKPROT*** option configures the number of protected tracks. In
hardware, this corresponds to installing or removing the
track-protection diodes on the Data PCA. The track count must be a power
of two from 1 to 128 on the 12606B interface and from 1 to 512, or 768,
on the 12610B interface. If the drive has fewer tracks than the
track-protection count, then all tracks on the drive are eligible for
protection.

The interface supports the ***LOAD DRC*** and ***BOOT DRC*** commands to
load a disc boot extension into memory. The ***LOAD*** command copies
the Basic Binary Disc Loader (BBDL) into memory, configures it for the
Data interface's select code, and sets the P register to the loader's
starting address. The ***BOOT*** command performs these same actions and
then presets the system and begins execution.

For a 2100/14/15/16 CPU containing a previously configured BBDL in
memory, the commands are equivalent in hardware to setting the P
register to the starting address, pressing the LOADER ENABLE button on
the front panel, and, for the ***BOOT*** command, pressing the INTERNAL
PRESET, EXTERNAL PRESET, and RUN buttons to begin execution. The S
register value is not relevant for this loader.

The BBDL is a dual-purpose loader that also permits loading an absolute
binary program from the paper tape reader. When the loader is copied
into memory, the disc/drum portion is configured for the select code of
the Data interface, and the paper tape portion is configured for the
select code of the paper tape reader interface. The P register is
automatically set to the starting address of the disc/drum portion,
which starts at x7760 (i.e., offset 1760 within the highest page in
memory). The loader stores a JMP \* instruction into location 77 octal
and then reads 64 words from track 0 sector 0 into memory starting at
location 0. Loader execution ends when the JMP \* is overlaid with a JMP
to the address of the start of the bootstrap extension just read. The
success or failure of the transfer is not checked.

To execute the paper tape portion, the P register may be reset to x7700
(offset 1700). Loader execution ends with one of the following halt
instructions:

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the tape value, B = the
    > calculated value.

-   HLT 55 --- the program load address would overlay the loader.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of tape was reached with a successful read.

The 1000 M/E/F-Series does not support this device. Attempting to
execute a ***LOAD DRC*** or ***BOOT DRC*** command will be rejected with
a **Command not allowed** error.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured for
each card separately by specifying the reporting level option:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and data
received and returned by the interface.

The Data PCA state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- -----------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Action***
  **IBUF**     16           8             Input buffer
  **OBUF**     16           8             Output buffer
  **CTL**      1            2             Control flip-flop
  **FLG**      1            2             Flag flip-flop
  **BPTR**     6            8             Sector buffer pointer
  ------------ ------------ ------------- -----------------------

The Control PCA state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Action***
  **CW**       16           8             Command word
  **STA**      16           8             Status word
  **RUN**      1            2             Run flip-flop
  **TIME**     24           10            Inter-word transfer time
  ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------------------

12821A Disc Interface with Four 7906H/7920H/7925H Drives
--------------------------------------------------------

The HP 12821A Disc Interface connects from one to four HP 7906H (20 MB),
7920H (50 MB), or 7925H (120 MB) Integrated Controller Disc (ICD) drives
to the HP 1000. These drives are identical to the 7906M, 7920M, and
7925M Multiple Access Controller (MAC) units but incorporate internal
two-card controllers in each drive and connect to the CPU interface via
the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus (HP-IB), HP's implementation of
IEEE-488. Each controller is dedicated to a single drive and operates
similarly to the 12745 Disc Controller to HP-IB Adapter option for the
13037 Disc Controller chassis. The 7906H was introduced in 1980 (there
was no 7905H version, as the 7905 was obsolete by that time). Up to four
ICD drives can be connected to a single 12821A card; bus loading and the
937.5 KB/second data transfer rate impose the limitation.

Attaching a disc image file to a unit simulates inserting a disc pack
into a drive:

ATTACH {-R \| -N} DAn \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch is equivalent to setting the
drive's Disc Protect or Read Only switch to the *On* position. Adding
the ***--N*** (new file) switch creates a full-size image file,
equivalent to formatting the new disc before use.

If the host operating system returns an error when seeking, reading, or
writing a disc image file, the simulator will report the error to the
simulation console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator disc library I/O error: No space left on device

A simulated disc seek will fail with Status 2 Error (Drive Fault)
status, and the drive's heads will unload. Reloading the heads will
clear the drive fault. A simulated disc read or write will fail with
Uncorrectable Data Error status. The target operating system will then
react to this error as though the drive had encountered a bad disc
sector.

A drive's unit number is not set explicitly. Instead, the drive unit
number is derived from the simulation unit number. For example, unit DA0
responds to disc unit select number 0. Changing the unit select switch
on a mounted drive is simulated by detaching and reattaching the disc
image file to the corresponding simulation unit.

Device and unit options include configuring the timing, drive type,
protection and format status, and the ability to set drives ready or
not-ready. The command forms are:

SET DA \<device-option\>\
SET DAn \<unit-option\>

### Device Options

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **ADDRESS=\<n\>**      Set the HP-IB address; default is 0
  **DIAGNOSTIC**         Connect the HP-IB cable to a second interface
  **HPIB**               Connect the HP-IB cable to the drives
  **SC=\<n\>**           Set the interface card select code; default is 43
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

The ***ADDRESS*** option configures the interface to use the specified
HP-IB address from 0-7. The interface address is independent of the disc
drive unit address and is only used for diagnostics.

Setting the ***DIAGNOSTIC*** option enables a second 12821A device
(named DC) and simulates the installation of an HP-IB cable between the
two 12821A Disc Interface cards as required by the HP 12821A ICD Disc
Interface Diagnostic. Setting the ***HPIB*** option disables the second
device and simulates the installation of an HP-IB cable between the
interface and the drives.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  ------------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***       ***Action***
  **SHOW DA**         Display the device and unit configuration
  **SHOW DA CABLE**   Display the HP-IB cable configuration
  **SHOW DA BUS**     Display the bus address
  ------------------- -------------------------------------------

### Unit Options

Unit options that may be specified for individual disc drives are:

  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***    ***Action***
  **7906H**       Set the drive type to 7906H; default
  **7920H**       Set the drive type to 7920H
  **7925H**       Set the drive type to 7925H
  **BUS=\<n\>**   Set the drive's HP-IB address; default is the unit number
  **UNLOAD**      Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Stop*; default when detached
  **LOAD**        Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Run*; default when attached
  **PROTECT**     Set the drive's Disc Protect or Read Only switch to *On*
  **UNPROTECT**   Set the drive's Disc Protect or Read Only switch to *Off*
  **FORMAT**      Set the drive's Format switch to *Enabled*
  **NOFORMAT**    Set the drive's Format switch to *Disabled*; default
  **ENABLED**     Enable the unit; default
  **DISABLED**    Disable the unit
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------

The ***7906H***, ***7920H***, and ***7925H*** options select the disc
drive model.

The ***BUS*** option sets the HP-IB address of the drive. Bus addresses
range from 0-7, and each unit's address must be unique. Each unit's bus
address is initially set to its unit number.

The ***UNLOAD*** and ***LOAD*** options unload and load the drive\'s
heads from the disc pack, setting the drive not-ready and ready,
respectively. The former provides a convenient method of setting a drive
\"down\" without detaching the associated disc image file.

The ***PROTECT*** option prevents writing to the disc. It is the
hardware equivalent of setting the 7906H Upper and Lower Disc Protect
switches or the 7920H or 7925H Read Only switch to the *On* position.
The ***UNPROTECT*** option enables writing and is equivalent to setting
the switches to *Off*. Separate protection for the upper and lower
platters of the 7906H drive is not supported.

The ***FORMAT*** option enables certain controller commands, such as
Initialize, that alter the sector address fields. Typically, this option
is needed when installing an operating system. The ***NOFORMAT*** option
inhibits these commands and permits only the standard Write command,
subject to the appropriate drive protection status.

Drive configuration may be displayed with the following command:

  ------------------ --------------------------------------------
  ***Command***      ***Action***
  **SHOW DA\<n\>**   Display the selected drive's configuration
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------

### LOAD and BOOT Commands

The interface supports the ***LOAD DA*** and ***BOOT DA*** commands to
load a disc boot extension into memory. The ***LOAD*** command copies
the 12992H boot loader ROM into memory, configures it for the
interface's select code, and sets the P register to the loader's
starting address. The ***BOOT*** command performs these same actions and
then presets the system and begins execution.

For a 1000 M/E/F-Series CPU, the commands are equivalent in hardware to
setting the S register to select and configure the HP 12992H boot loader
ROM, pressing the IBL button to copy the ROM into memory, and, for the
***BOOT*** command, pressing the PRESET and RUN buttons to begin
execution. The S register is preset as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***         ***10***    ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***
  0          0          0          1          DA select code   unchanged   0         head                                                                            
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

The head number is obtained from bits 1-0 of the existing S-register
value when the loader is executed. Bits 5-3 of the existing S-register
value are also retained and are available to the boot extension program.

The loader reads 620 words from cylinder 0 sector 0 of the specified
head into memory starting at location 2011 octal. Loader execution ends
with one of the following instructions:

-   HLT 11 --- the drive aborted the transfer due to an unrecoverable
    > error.

-   JSB 2055,I --- the disc read succeeded.

The 2100/14/15/16 CPU does not support this device. Attempting to
execute a ***LOAD DA*** or ***BOOT DA*** command will be rejected with a
**Command not allowed** error.

### Tracing and Registers

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **RWSC**       Controller read, write, status, and control commands
  **CMDS**       Interface commands received from the CPU
  **CPU**        Words received from and sent to the CPU
  **BUF**        Data read from and written to the interface FIFO
  **XFER**       Data received and transmitted via HP-IB
  **SERV**       Disc unit service events
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***RWSC*** option traces the read, write, status, and control
commands executed by the disc controller. The ***CMDS*** option traces
the commands executed by the interface. The ***CPU*** option traces
words received from (control and write data) and sent to (status and
read data) the CPU. The ***BUF*** option traces loads into and unloads
from the interface FIFO. The ***XFER*** option traces the data words
read from or written to the disc. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O
backplane signals and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>DA rwsc: Unit 1 position 1069056 seek disc command initiated\
\>\>DA rwsc: Unit 1 seek disc command completed\
\>\>DA cmds: \[STC\] Control set (data mode)\
\>\>DA cmds: SRQ cleared\
\>\>DA cpu: \[OTx\] Control = 004003\
\>\>DA cpu: \[LIx,C\] Data = 063613\
\>\>DA buf: Data 277 tag ATN \| EDT unloaded from FIFO (0)\
\>\>DA buf: FIFO cleared\
\>\>DA xfer: Data 100677 tag ATN \| EDT loaded into FIFO (1)\
\>\>DA xfer: HP-IB DIO 277 signals ATN available\
\>\>DA xfer: HP-IB address 0 accepted unlisten\
\>\>DA xfer: HP-IB address 1 accepted secondary 08H\
\>\>DA serv: Unit 1 state read transfer delay 3 service scheduled\
\>\>DA serv: Unit 1 state command execution delay 100 service scheduled\
\>\>DA iobus: Received data 000000 with signals CLC \| CLF \| SIR \|

\>\>DA iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals PRL

The Disc Interface state contains these registers:

  ---------------------- ------------ ------------- ----------------------------------------------
  ***Name***             ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Description***
  **CWR**                16           8             Control word register

13175D Disc Controller Interface with Eight 7905/7906/7920/7925 Drives
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The HP 13175D Disc Controller Interface connects 7905A (15 MB), 7906A
(20 MB), 7920A (50 MB), and 7925A (120 MB) disc drives to the HP 1000.
The subsystem consists of the interface, a 13037D Multiple Access
Controller (MAC), and from one to eight MAC drives. The subsystem uses
DCPC to achieve a 937.5 KB/second transfer rate to the CPU.

The disc controller connects from one to eight disc drives to interfaces
installed in from one to eight CPUs. The drives use a common command set
and present data to the controller synchronously at a 468.75 kiloword
per second (2.133 microseconds per word) data rate.

The disc interface is used to connect the HP 1000 CPU to the 13037's
device controller. While the controller supports multiple-CPU systems in
hardware, the simulator does not provide this capability.

Attaching a disc image file to a unit simulates inserting a disc pack
into a drive:

ATTACH {-R \| -N} DSn \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch is equivalent to setting the
drive's Disc Protect or Read Only switch to the *On* position. Adding
the ***--N*** (new file) switch creates a full-size image file,
equivalent to formatting the new disc before use.

If the host operating system returns an error when seeking, reading, or
writing a disc image file, the simulator will report the error to the
simulation console, e.g.:

HP 2100 simulator disc library I/O error: No space left on device

A simulated disc seek will fail with Status 2 Error (Drive Fault)
status, and the drive's heads will unload. Reloading the heads will
clear the drive fault. A simulated disc read or write will fail with
Uncorrectable Data Error status. The target operating system will then
react to this error as though the drive had encountered a bad disc
sector.

A drive's unit number is not set explicitly. Instead, the drive unit
number is derived from the simulation unit number. For example, unit DS0
responds to disc unit select number 0. Changing the unit select switch
on a mounted drive is simulated by detaching and reattaching the disc
image file to the corresponding simulation unit.

Device and unit options include configuring the timing, drive type,
protection and format status, and the ability to set drives ready or
not-ready. The command forms are:

SET DS \<device-option\>\
SET DSn \<unit-option\>

### Device Options

Device options that may be specified are:

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***           ***Action***
  **SC=\<n\>**           Set the interface card select code; default is 34
  **DEBUG=\<option\>**   Enable tracing
  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  --------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***   ***Action***
  **SHOW DS**     Display the device and unit configuration
  --------------- -------------------------------------------

### Unit Options

Unit options that may be specified for individual disc drives are:

  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***    ***Action***
  **7905**        Set the drive type to 7905; default
  **7906**        Set the drive type to 7906
  **7920**        Set the drive type to 7920
  **7925**        Set the drive type to 7925
  **AUTOSIZE**    Set the drive type based on the attached file size
  **UNLOAD**      Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Stop*; default when detached
  **LOAD**        Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Run*; default when attached
  **PROTECT**     Set the drive's Disc Protect or Read Only switch to *On*
  **UNPROTECT**   Set the drive's Disc Protect or Read Only switch to *Off*
  **FORMAT**      Set the drive's Format switch to *Enabled*
  **NOFORMAT**    Set the drive's Format switch to *Disabled*; default
  **ENABLED**     Enable the unit; default
  **DISABLED**    Disable the unit
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------

The ***7905***, ***7906***, ***7920***, and ***7925*** options select
the disc drive model. The ***AUTOSIZE*** option selects the disc drive
model by the size of the attached disc image file. The algorithm selects
the smallest-capacity drive capable of supporting the image. This option
is useful when several previously written images of various sizes are
attached sequentially.

The ***UNLOAD*** and ***LOAD*** options unload and load the drive\'s
heads from the disc pack, setting the drive not-ready and ready,
respectively. The former option provides a convenient method of setting
a drive \"down\" without detaching the associated disc image file.

The ***PROTECT*** option prevents writing to the disc. It is the
hardware equivalent of setting the 7905 or 7906 Upper and Lower Disc
Protect switches or the 7920 or 7925 Read Only switch to the *On*
position. The ***UNPROTECT*** option enables writing and is equivalent
to setting the switches to *Off*. Separate protection for the upper and
lower platters of the 7905 and 7906 drives is not supported.

The ***FORMAT*** option enables certain controller commands, such as
Initialize, that alter the sector address fields. Typically, this option
is needed when installing the operating system. The ***NOFORMAT***
option inhibits these commands and permits only the standard Write
command, subject to the appropriate drive protection status.

Drive configuration may be displayed with the following command:

  ------------------ --------------------------------------------
  ***Command***      ***Action***
  **SHOW DS\<n\>**   Display the selected drive's configuration
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------

### LOAD and BOOT Commands

The interface supports the ***LOAD DS*** and ***BOOT DS*** commands to
load a disc boot extension into memory. Depending on the current CPU
model, the ***LOAD*** command copies either the Basic Moving-Head Disc
Loader (BMDL-7905) or the 12992B boot loader ROM into memory, configures
it for the interface's select code, and sets the P register to the
loader's starting address. The ***BOOT*** command performs these same
actions and then presets the system and begins execution.

For a 2100/14/15/16 CPU containing a previously configured BMDL in
memory, the commands are equivalent in hardware to setting the P
register to the starting address, pressing the LOADER ENABLE button on
the front panel, and, for the ***BOOT*** command, pressing the INTERNAL
PRESET, EXTERNAL PRESET, and RUN buttons to begin execution.

The BMDL is a dual-purpose loader that also permits loading an absolute
binary program from the paper tape reader. When the loader is copied
into memory, the disc portion is configured for the select code of the
disc interface, and the paper tape portion is configured for the select
code of the paper tape reader interface. The P register is automatically
set to the starting address of the disc portion, which starts at x7750
(i.e., offset 1750 within the highest page in memory). Before execution,
the S register must be set as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***   ***10***   ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***
  0          0          0          0          0          0          0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         head      
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

The loader stores the value 002055 into location 2055 octal, stores a
HLT 11 into location 2056 octal, and then reads 2047 words from cylinder
0 sector 0 of the specified head into memory starting at location 2011
octal. Loader execution ends with one of the following instructions:

-   HLT 11 --- the disc read failed.

-   JSB 2055,I --- the disc read succeeded.

To execute the paper tape portion, the P register may be reset to x7700
(offset 1700). Loader execution ends with one of the following halt
instructions:

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the tape value, B = the
    > calculated value.

-   HLT 55 --- the program load address would overlay the loader.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of tape was reached with a successful read.

For a 1000 M/E/F-Series CPU, the commands are equivalent in hardware to
setting the S register to select and configure the HP 12992B boot loader
ROM, pressing the IBL button to copy the ROM into memory, and, for the
***BOOT*** command, pressing the PRESET and RUN buttons to begin
execution. The S register is preset as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***         ***10***    ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***
  0          0          0          1          DS select code   unchanged   0         head                                                                            
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

The head number is obtained from bits 1-0 of the existing S-register
value when the loader is executed. Bits 5-3 of the existing S-register
value are also retained and are available to the boot extension program.

Loader execution ends with one of the following instructions:

-   HLT 30 --- the drive is not ready.

-   JSB 2055,I --- the disc read succeeded.

### Tracing and Registers

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **RWSC**       Controller read, write, status, and control commands
  **CMDS**       Interface commands received from the CPU
  **CPU**        Words received from and sent to the CPU
  **BUF**        Data read from and written to the interface FIFO
  **SERV**       Disc unit service events
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***RWSC*** option traces the read, write, status, and control
commands executed by the disc controller. The ***CMDS*** option traces
the commands executed by the interface. The ***CPU*** option traces
words received from (control and write data) and sent to (status and
read data) the CPU. The ***BUF*** option traces loads into and unloads
from the interface FIFO. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane
signals and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>DS rwsc: Unit 0 position 0 cold load read command initiated\
\>\>DS rwsc: Controller address record command completed\
\>\>DS cmds: \[STF\] Flag set\
\>\>DS cmds: \[LIx\] SRQ cleared\
\>\>DS cpu: \[OTx,C\] Command = 001200\
\>\>DS cpu: \[EDT\] DCPC transfer ended\
\>\>DS buf: Data 020334 loaded into FIFO (5)\
\>\>DS buf: Data 170001 unloaded from FIFO (0)\
\>\>DS serv: Unit 0 delay 2400 service scheduled\
\>\>DS serv: Controller delay 3 service scheduled\
\>\>DS iobus: Received data 021057 with signals IOO \| CLF \| EDT \|
SIR\
\>\>DS iobus: Returned data 174163 with signals (none)

The Disc Interface state contains these registers:

  ---------------------- ------------ ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  ***Name***             ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Description***

Magnetic Tape I/O Device Simulations
====================================

The simulator provides these magnetic tape device interfaces and their
associated peripherals:

-   12559C 9-Track Magnetic Tape Unit Interface

-   13181B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interface

-   13183B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interface

12559C 9-Track Magnetic Tape Unit Interface with One 3030 Drive
---------------------------------------------------------------

The 12559C 9-Track Magnetic Tape Unit Interface connects one HP 3030
800-bpi NRZI ½-inch magnetic tape drive to the HP computer family. The
interface consists of two Printed Circuit Assemblies installed in
adjacent I/O slots. The Data PCA is assigned the higher-priority (lower
numbered) select code, and the Control PCA is assigned the
lower-priority select code. The MTD and MTC devices simulate these PCAs

Attaching a tape image file simulates mounting a tape reel on a drive:

ATTACH {-R} {-F} MTC {\<format\>} \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch is equivalent to mounting the
tape without a write ring in place. Adding the ***--F*** switch and a
format identifier declares the tape image format to be used. Supported
formats are ***SIMH***, ***E11***, ***TPC***, and ***P7B***. If the
***--F*** switch and a format identifier are not supplied, then SIMH
tape image format is used. Note that erase gaps embedded in the tape
image file are supported only in SIMH image format mode.

If the host operating system returns an error when reading or writing a
tape image file, the simulator will report the error to the simulation
console, e.g.:

HP 2100: Magtape library I/O error: No space left on device

If this or another tape library error occurs, e.g., due to an illegal or
damaged tape format, the simulator stops with an appropriate error
message. Resuming the simulation will fail the tape operation with Tape
Error status. The target operating system will then react to this error
as though the drive had encountered a bad tape block (CRCC or LRCC
error).

Device options that may be specified with the ***SET MTC*** command are:

  -------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***         ***Action***
  **FORMAT=\<fmt\>**   Set the tape image format; default is SIMH format
  **SC=\<n\>**         Set the interface card select codes; defaults are 20/11
  **ENABLED**          Enable the device;
  **DISABLED**         Disable the device; default
  -------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

The tape image format for future ***ATTACH*** commands may be set to one
of the format identifiers listed above. The unit must be detached when
the format is set.

When entering the ***SC*** option, specify the lower select code with
either device name; the higher select code will be set automatically,
and the cards will be assigned in the correct order.

Drive configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  --------------------- ---------------------------------------
  ***Command***         ***Action***
  **SHOW MTC**          Display the drive's configuration
  **SHOW MTC FORMAT**   Display the drive's tape image format
  --------------------- ---------------------------------------

The ***BOOT*** command is not supported. The 12559C is disabled by
default.

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured for
each card separately by specifying the reporting level option:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and data
received and returned by the interface.

The Data PCA state contains these registers:

  ---------------------- ------------ ------------- ------------------------
  ***Name***             ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Action***
  **FLG**                1            2             Flag flip-flop
  **FBF**                1            2             Flag buffer flip-flop
  **DBUF \[0:65535\]**   8            8             Tape record buffer
  **BPTR**               17           10            Buffer pointer
  **BMAX**               17           10            Buffer size for writes
  ---------------------- ------------ ------------- ------------------------

The Control PCA state contains these registers:

  ------------ ------------ ------------- ---------------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Radix***   ***Action***
  **FNC**      8            8             Current function
  **STA**      9            8             Tape status
  **BUF**      8            8             Command buffer
  **CTL**      1            2             Control flip-flop
  **FLG**      1            2             Flag flip-flop
  **FBF**      1            2             Flag buffer flip-flop
  **DTF**      1            2             Data transfer flip-flop
  **FSVC**     1            2             First service flip-flop
  **POS**      32           10            Tape position
  **CTIME**    24           10            Command delay time
  **GTIME**    24           10            Inter-record gap traversal time
  **XTIME**    24           10            Inter-word transfer time
  ------------ ------------ ------------- ---------------------------------

13181B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interface with Four 7970B Drives, 13183B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interface with Four 7970E Drives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HP 13181B and 13183B Digital Magnetic Tape Unit Interfaces connect
from one to four HP 7970B 800-bpi NRZI and HP 7970E 1600-bpi PE ½-inch
magnetic tape drives, respectively, to the HP computer family. Both
interfaces consist of two Printed Circuit Assemblies installed in
adjacent I/O slots. The Data PCA is assigned the higher-priority (lower
numbered) select code, and the Control PCA is assigned the
lower-priority select code. The MSD and MSC devices simulate these PCAs.

Attaching a tape image file to a unit simulates mounting a tape reel on
a drive:

ATTACH {-R} {-F} MSCn {\<format\>} \<image-filename\>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch is equivalent to mounting the
tape without a write ring in place. Adding the ***--F*** switch and a
format identifier declares the tape image format to be used. Supported
formats are ***SIMH***, ***E11***, ***TPC***, and ***P7B***. If the
***--F*** switch and a format identifier are not supplied, then SIMH
tape image format is used. Note that erase gaps embedded in the tape
image file are supported only in SIMH image format mode.

If the host operating system returns an error when reading or writing a
tape image file, the simulator will report the error to the simulation
console, e.g.:

HP 2100: Magtape library I/O error: No space left on device

If this or another tape library error occurs, e.g., due to an illegal or
damaged tape format, the simulator stops with an appropriate error
message. Resuming the simulation will fail the tape operation with Tape
Error status. The target operating system will then react to this error
as though the drive had encountered a bad tape block (CRCC/LRCC or
STE/MTE error).

A drive's unit number is not set explicitly. Instead, the drive unit
number is derived from the simulation unit number. For example, unit
MSC0 responds to tape unit select number 0. Pressing a different unit
select button on a mounted drive is equivalent to detaching and
reattaching the tape image file to the corresponding simulation unit.
Pressing the *OFF* button is equivalent to setting the drive offline.

Device and unit options include configuring the drive type and timing,
tape reel size, tape image format, and the ability to set drives offline
or online. The command forms are:

SET MSC \<device-option\>\
SET MSCn \<unit-option\>

  **NODEBUG**            Disable tracing; default
  **ENABLED**            Enable the device; default
  **DISABLED**           Disable the device
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

The ***13181*** and ***13183*** options set the interface type and, by
implication, the tape drive type.

When realistic timing is enabled, the simulation accurately models the
tape movement times (in machine instructions). For example, rewinding
takes longer if the tape is positioned farther from the load point.
Realistic timing is necessary to pass the magnetic tape diagnostic
timing tests.

Optimized timing reduces the timing to the minimum necessary to operate
correctly; this is much faster than the real tape drive would operate.
In addition, enabling optimized timing also omits the initial erase gap
normally written after the BOT marker and the erase gap written by the
Gap and File Mark (GFM), which is executed as a Write File Mark (WFM)
command. This does not affect gaps written with the Write Gap command.

The delay times used by the simulator in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set
via the register interface. The values may be adjusted as necessary to
work around any HP software problems that are triggered by the unusually
rapid tape operation. Resetting the device with the ***RESET --P***
(power-on reset) command restores the original optimized times.

When entering the ***SC*** option, specify the lower select code with
either device name; the higher select code will be set automatically,
and the cards will be assigned in the correct order.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  --------------------- -------------------------------------------
  ***Command***         ***Action***
  **SHOW MSC**          Display the device and unit configuration
  **SHOW MSC TIMING**   Display the timing mode
  **SHOW MSC TYPE**     Display the interface type
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------

### Unit Options

Unit options that may be specified for individual tape drives are:

  -------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***         ***Action***
  **OFFLINE**          Set the unit offline; default when detached
  **ONLINE**           Set the unit online; default when attached
  **REEL=\<n\>**       Set the reel size in feet; default is unlimited
  **CAPACITY=\<n\>**   Set the reel capacity in megabytes; default is unlimited
  **FORMAT=\<fmt\>**   Set the tape image format; default is SIMH format
  **ENABLED**          Enable the unit; default
  **DISABLED**         Disable the unit
  -------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

The ***OFFLINE*** and ***ONLINE*** options place a drive offline and
online, respectively. The former provides a convenient method of setting
a drive \"down\" without detaching the associated tape image file.

The reel size may be set to ***600***-, ***1200***-, or ***2400***-foot
capacity. Setting the capacity or reel size to ***0*** specifies
unlimited capacity; in this configuration, the interface never returns
an end-of-tape indication.

The tape image format for future ***ATTACH*** commands may be set to one
of the format identifiers listed above. The unit must be detached when
the format is set.

Drive configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

  ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  ***Command***                ***Action***
  **SHOW MSC\<n\>**            Display the selected drive's configuration
  **SHOW MSC\<n\> REEL**       Display the selected drive's reel size or capacity
  **SHOW MSC\<n\> CAPACITY**   Display the selected drive's reel size or capacity
  **SHOW MSC\<n\> FORMAT**     Display the selected drive's tape image format
  ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------

### LOAD and BOOT Commands

The interface supports the ***LOAD {--S} MSC*** and ***BOOT{--S} MSC***
commands to load an absolute binary program into memory. Depending on
the current CPU model, the ***LOAD*** command copies either the Basic
Magnetic Tape Loader (BMTL) or the 12992D boot loader ROM into memory,
configures it for the Data interface's select code, and sets the P
register to the loader's starting address. The ***BOOT*** command
performs these same actions and then presets the system and begins
execution.

For a 2100/14/15/16 CPU containing a previously configured BMTL in
memory, the commands are equivalent in hardware to setting the P
register to the starting address, pressing the LOADER ENABLE button on
the front panel, and, for the ***BOOT*** command, pressing the INTERNAL
PRESET, EXTERNAL PRESET, and RUN buttons to begin execution. Before
execution, the S register must be set as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***   ***10***   ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***       ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***
  0          0          0          0          0          0          0         0         0         0         file number                                           
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

If S-register bits 5-0 are zero, the file located at the current tape
position is read. If the bits are non-zero, the tape is rewound, and the
file number (1 - n) specified by the bits is read. The tape format must
be absolute binary, and a tape mark must end each file. Loader execution
ends with one of the following instructions:

-   HLT 00 --- a tape read (parity) error occurred.

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the calculated value, B =
    > the tape value.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of the file was reached with a successful read.

For a 1000 M/E/F-Series CPU, the commands are equivalent in hardware to
setting the S register to select and configure the HP 12992D boot loader
ROM, pressing the IBL button to copy the ROM into memory, and, for the
***BOOT*** command, pressing the PRESET and RUN buttons to begin
execution. The S register is preset as follows:

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  ***15***   ***14***   ***13***   ***12***   ***11***          ***10***    ***9***   ***8***   ***7***   ***6***   ***5***   ***4***   ***3***   ***2***   ***1***   ***0***
  1          0          0          0          MSD select code   unchanged   0         0                                                                              
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------- ----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

If the ***--S*** switch is specified, bit 0 is set to 1 to rewind the
tape and then load the file number (1 - n) specified in the A register.
If ***--S*** is not specified, then bit 0 is set to 0 to load the file
located at the current tape position. Bits 5-3 of the existing
S-register value are retained when the loader is executed and are
available to the loaded program.

Loader execution ends with one of the following halt instructions:

-   HLT 00 --- a tape read (parity) error occurred.

-   HLT 11 --- a checksum error occurred; A = the calculated value, B =
    > the tape value.

-   HLT 77 --- the end of the file was reached with a successful read.

### Tracing and Registers

When a debug log has been established, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  ***Option***   ***Reporting Level***
  **CMDS**       Controller command initiations and completions
  **RWS**        Tape reads, writes, and status returns
  **CPU**        Words received from and sent to the CPU
  **IOBUS**      I/O bus signals and data words received and returned
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------

The ***CMDS*** option traces the commands executed by the tape
controller. The ***RWS*** option traces the read, write, and status
commands executed by the controller. The ***CPU*** option traces words
received from (control and write data) and sent to (status and read
data) the CPU. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals
and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

\>\>MSC cmds: Unit 0 command 023 (RRF) scheduled, pos = 0, time = 1001\
\>\>MSC cmds: Unit 0 command 023 (RRF) complete\
\>\>MSC rws: Unit 0 read 33 word record\
\>\>MSC rws: Unit 0 tape library status = 1\
\>\>MSC cpu: Command = 000101\
\>\>MSC cpu: Status = 000004\
\>\>MSC iobus: Received data 000000 with signals STC \| CLF \| SIR \|
PRH\
\>\>MSC iobus: Returned data 000020 with signals PRL
