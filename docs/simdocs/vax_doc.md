The CR, DZ, VH, LPT, RL, RQ, RQB, RQC, RQD, RY, TS, TQ, XQ, and XQB
devices can be set DISABLED. RQB, RQC, RQD, VH, and XQB are disabled by
default.

The VAX simulator implements several unique stop conditions:

  - Change mode to interrupt stack

  - Illegal vector (bits\<1:0\> = 2 or 3)

  - Unexpected exception during interrupt or exception

  - Process PTE in P0 or P1 space instead of system space

  - Unknown IPL

  - Infinite loop (BRB/W to self at IPL 1F)

The LOAD command supports a simple binary format, consisting of a stream
of binary bytes without origin or checksum, for loading memory, the boot
ROM, or the non-volatile memory. The DUMP command is not implemented.

## CPU and System Devices

### CPU

CPU options include the size of main memory and the treatment of the
HALT instruction.

SET CPU 16M set memory size = 16MB

SET CPU 32M set memory size = 32MB

SET CPU 48M set memory size = 48MB

SET CPU 64M set memory size = 64MB

SET CPU 128M set memory size = 128MB

SET CPU 256M set memory size = 256MB

SET CPU 512M set memory size = 512MB

SET CPU SIMHALT kernel HALT returns to simulator

SET CPU CONHALT kernel HALT returns to boot ROM console

The CPU also implements a command to display a virtual to physical
address translation:

SHOW {-kesu} CPU VIRTUAL=n show translation for address n

in kernel/exec/supervisor/user mode

Notes on memory size:

  - The real KA655 CPU only supported 16MB to 64MB of memory. The
    simulator implements a KA655"X", which increases supported memory to
    512MB.

  - The firmware (ka655x.bin) contains code to determine the size of
    extended memory and set up the PFN bit map accordingly. Other than
    setting up the PFN bit map, the firmware does not recognize extended
    memory and will behave as though memory size was 64MB.

  - If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated
    contains non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in
    the truncated portion of memory is lost.

  - If the simulator is running VMS, the operating system may have a
    SYSGEN parameter set called PHYSICAL PAGES (viewable from "MCR
    SYSGEN SHOW PHYSICALPAGES"). PHYSICALPAGES limits the maximum number
    of physical pages of memory the OS will recognize. If it is set to a
    lower value than the new memory size of the machine, then only the
    first PHYSICALPAGES of memory will be recognized, otherwise the
    actual size of the extended memory will be realized by VMS upon each
    boot. Some users and/or sites may specify the PHYSICALPAGES
    parameter in the input file to AUTOGEN (SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT).
    If PHYSICALPAGES is specified there, it will have to be adjusted
    before running AUTOGEN to recognize more memory. The default value
    for PHYSICALPAGES is 1048576, which describes 512MB of RAM.

Initial memory size is 16MB.

Memory can be loaded with a binary byte stream using the LOAD command.
The LOAD command recognizes three switches:

\-o origin argument follows file name

\-r load the boot ROM

\-n load the non-volatile RAM

The CPU supports the BOOT command and is the only VAX device to do so.
Note that the behavior of the bootstrap depends on the capabilities of
the console terminal emulator. If the terminal window supports full
VT100 emulation (including Multilanguage Character Set support), the
bootstrap will ask the user to specify the language; otherwise, it will
default to English.

These switches are recognized when examining or depositing in CPU
memory:

\-b examine/deposit bytes

\-w examine/deposit words

\-l examine/deposit longwords

\-d data radix is decimal

\-o data radix is octal

\-h data radix is hexadecimal

\-m examine (only) VAX instructions

\-p examine/deposit PDP-11 (compatibility mode) instructions

\-r examine (only) RADIX50 encoded data

\-v interpret address as virtual, current mode

\-k interpret address as virtual, kernel mode

\-e interpret address as virtual, executive mode

\-s interpret address as virtual, supervisor mode

\-u interpret address as virtual, user mode

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

The CPU attempts to detect when the simulator is idle. When idle, the
simulator does not use any resources on the host system. Idle detection
is controlled by the SET IDLE and SET NOIDLE commands:

SET CPU IDLE{=VMS|ULTRIX| ULTRIXOLD|ULTRIX-1.X|

3BSD|4.0BSD|4.1BSD|4.2BSD|QUASIJARUS

NETBSD|NETBSDOLD|OPENBSD|OPENBSDOLD|32V|ELN}{:n}

enable idle detection

SET CPU NOIDLE disable idle detection

Idle detection is disabled by default. If idle detection is enabled with
an incorrect operating system setting, simulator performance could be
impacted. The default operating system setting is VMS. The value ‘n’, if
present in the “SET CPU IDLE={OS}:n” command, indicates the number of
seconds the simulator must run before idling starts.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU {-T} HISTORY=n{:file} enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The –T switch causes simulator time to be recorded (and displayed) with
each history entry.

When writing history to a file (SET CPU HISTORY=n:file), ‘n’ specifies
the buffer flush frequency. Warning: prodigious amounts of disk space
may be consumed. The maximum length for the history is 250000 entries.

### Translation Buffer (TLB)

The translation buffer consists of two units, representing the system
and user translation buffers, respectively. It has no registers. Each
translation buffer entry consists of two 32b words, as follows:

word n tag

word n+1 cached PTE

An invalid entry is indicated by a tag of 0xFFFFFFFF.

### Qbus Adapter (QBA)

The QBA simulates the CQBIC Qbus adapter chip. It recognizes the
following options:

SET QBA AUTOCONFIGURE enable autoconfiguration

SET QBA NOAUTOCONFIGURE disable autoconfiguration

and the following display command:

SHOW QBA IOSPACE show I/O space address map

The QBA also implements a command to display a Qbus address to physical
address translation:

SHOW QBA VIRTUAL=n show translation for Qbus address n

Finally, the QBA implements main memory examination and modification via
the Qbus map. The data width is always 16b:

EX QBA 0/10 examine main memory words corresponding

> to Qbus addresses 0-10

The QBA registers are:

name size comments

SCR 16 system configuration register

DSER 8 DMA system error register

MEAR 13 master error address register

SEAR 20 slave error address register

MBR 29 Qbus map base register

IPC 16 interprocessor communications register

IPL17 32 IPL 17 interrupt flags

IPL16 32 IPL 16 interrupt flags

IPL15 32 IPL 15 interrupt flags

IPL14 32 IPL 14 interrupt flags

### Read-only memory (ROM)

The boot ROM consists of a single unit, simulating the 128KB boot ROM.
It has no registers. The boot ROM is loaded with a binary byte stream
using the LOAD -r command:

LOAD -r KA655X.BIN load ROM image KA655X.BIN

ROM accesses a use a calibrated delay that slows ROM-based execution to
about 500K instructions per second. This delay is required to make the
power-up self-test routines run correctly on very fast hosts. The delay
is controlled with the commands:

SET ROM NODELAY ROM runs like RAM

SET ROM DELAY ROM runs slowly

### Non-volatile Memory (NVR)

The NVR consists of a single unit, simulating 1KB of battery-backed up
memory in the SSC chip. When the simulator starts, NVR is cleared to 0,
and the SSC battery-low indicator is set. Normally, NVR is saved and
restored like other memory in the system. Alternately, NVR can be
attached to a file. This allows its contents to be saved and restored
independently of other memories, so that NVR state can be preserved
across simulator runs.

Successfully loading an NVR image clears the SSC battery-low indicator.

### System Devices (SYSD)

The system devices are the system-specific facilities implemented in the
CVAX chip, the KA655 CPU board, the CMCTL memory controller, and the SSC
system support chip. Note that the simulation of these devices is
incomplete and is intended strictly to allow the patched bootstrap and
console code to run. The SYSD registers are:

name size comments

CADR 8 cache disable register

MSER 8 memory system error register

CONPC 32 PC at console halt

CONPSL 32 PSL at console halt

CMCSR\[0:17\] 32 CMCTL control and status registers

CACR 8 second-level cache control register

BDR 8 front panel jumper register

BASE 29 SSC base address register

CNF 32 SSC configuration register

BTO 32 SSC bus timeout register

TCSR0 32 SSC timer 0 control/status register

TIR0 32 SSC timer 0 interval register

TNIR0 32 SSC timer 0 next interval register

TIVEC0 9 SSC timer 0 interrupt vector register

TCSR1 32 SSC timer 1 control/status register

TIR1 32 SSC timer 1 interval register

TNIR1 32 SSC timer 1 next interval register

TIVEC1 9 SSC timer 1 interrupt vector register

ADSM0 32 SSC address match 0 address

ADSK0 32 SSC address match 0 mask

ADSM1 32 SSC address match 1 address

ADSK1 32 SSC address match 1 mask

CDGDAT\[0:16383\] 32 cache diagnostic data store

BDR\<7\> is the halt-enabled switch. It controls how the console
firmware responds to a BOOT command, a kernel halt (if option CONHALT is
set), or a console halt (BREAK typed on the console terminal). If
BDR\<7\> is set, the console firmware responds to all these conditions
by entering its interactive command mode. If BDR\<7\> is clear, the
console firmware boots the operating system in response to these
conditions. This bit can be set and cleared by the command “SET CPU
AUTOBOOT” (clearing the flag) and “SET CPU NOAUTOBOOT” setting the flag.
The default value is set.

## I/O Device Addressing

Qbus I/O space is not large enough to allow all possible devices to be
configured simultaneously at fixed addresses. Instead, many devices have
floating addresses; that is, the assigned device address depends on the
presence of other devices in the configuration:

DZ11 all instances have floating addresses

DHQ11 all instances have floating addresses

RL11 first instance has fixed address, rest floating

RXV211 first instance has fixed address, rest floating

MSCP disk first instance has fixed address, rest floating

TMSCP tape first instance has fixed address, rest floating

To maintain addressing consistency as the configuration changes, the
simulator implements DEC's standard I/O address and vector
autoconfiguration algorithms for all Qbus devices. This allows the user
to enable or disable devices without needing to manage I/O addresses and
vectors.

In addition to autoconfiguration, most devices support the SET
\<device\> ADDRESS command, which allows the I/O page address of the
device to be changed, and the SET \<device\> VECTOR command, which
allows the vector of the device to be changed. Explicitly setting the
I/O address or vector of a device DISABLES autoconfiguration for that
device and for the entire system. As a consequence, the user may have to
manually configure all other autoconfigured devices, because the
autoconfiguration algorithm no longer recognizes the explicitly
configured device. A device can be reset to autoconfigure with the SET
\<device\> AUTOCONFIGURE command. Autoconfiguration can be restored for
the entire system with the SET QBA AUTOCONFIGURE command.

The current I/O map can be displayed with the SHOW QBA IOSPACE command.
Addresses that have set by autoconfiguration are marked with an asterisk
(\*).

All devices support the SHOW \<device\> ADDRESS and SHOW \<device\>
VECTOR commands, which display the device address and vector,
respectively.

## Programmed I/O Devices

### Terminal Input (TTI)

The terminal interfaces (TTI, TTO) can be set to one of three modes, 7P,
7B or 8B:

mode input characters output characters

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default mode is 8B.

When the console terminal is attached to a Telnet session or the
simulator is running from a Windows command prompt, it recognizes BREAK.
If BREAK is entered, and BDR\<7\> is set, control returns to the console
firmware; otherwise, BREAK is treated as a normal terminal input
condition.

The terminal input (TTI) polls the console keyboard for input. It
implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

CSR 16 control/status register

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CSR\<15\>)

DONE 1 device done flag (CSR\<7\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR\<6\>)

POS 32 number of characters input

TIME 24 input polling interval (if 0, the keyboard

is polled synchronously with the TODR)

### Terminal Output (TTO)

The terminal output (TTO) writes to the simulator console window. It
implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

CSR 16 control/status register

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CSR\<15\>)

DONE 1 device done flag (CSR\<7\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR\<6\>)

POS 32 number of characters input

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

### LPV11 Line Printer (LPT)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer.

The line printer implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

CSR 16 control/status register

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CSR\<15\>)

DONE 1 device done flag (CSR\<7\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR\<6\>)

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Real-Time Clock (CLK)

The clock (CLK) implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR 16 control/status register

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR\<6\>)

TODR 32 time-of-day register

BLOW 1 TODR battery low indicator

TIME 24 clock frequency

TPS 8 ticks per second (100)

The real-time clock autocalibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

There are two modes of TODR operation.

1.  Default VMS mode. Without initializing the TODR it returns the
    current time of year offset which VMS would set the clock to if VMS
    knew the correct time (i.e. by manual input). This is correct almost
    all the time unless a VMS disk hadn’t been booted from in the
    current year. This mode produces strange time results for non VMS
    OSes on each system boot.

2.  OS Agnostic mode. This mode behaves precisely like the VAX780 TODR
    and works correctly for all OSes. This mode is enabled by attaching
    the CLK to a battery backup state file for the TOY clock (i.e. sim\>
    attach CLK TOY\_CLOCK). When operating in OS Agnostic mode, the TODR
    will initially start counting from 0 and be adjusted differently
    when an OS specifically writes to the TODR. VMS determines if the
    TODR currently contains a valid time if the value it sees is less
    than about 1 month. If the time isn't valid VMS will prompt to set
    the time during the system boot. While prompting for the time it
    will wait for an answer to the prompt for up to the SYSGEN parameter
    TIMEPROMPTWAIT seconds. A value of 0 for TIMEPROMPTWAIT will disable
    the clock setting prompt.

## Disks

### RLV12/RL01,RL02 Cartridge Disk (RL)

RLV12 options include the ability to set units write enabled or write
locked, to set the drive type to RL01, RL02, or autosize, and to write a
DEC standard 044 compliant bad block table on the last track:

SET RLn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET RLn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

SET RLn RL01 set type to RL01

SET RLn RL02 set type to RL02

SET RLn AUTOSIZE set type based on file size at ATTACH

SET RLn BADBLOCK write bad block table on last track

The type options can be used only when a unit is not attached to a file.
The bad block option can be used only when a unit is attached to a file.
Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The RLV12 does not support
the BOOT command.

The RLV12 implements these registers:

name size comments

RLCS 16 control/status

RLDA 16 disk address

RLBA 16 memory address

RLBAE 6 memory address extension (RLV12)

RLMP,RLMP1,RLMP2 16 multipurpose register queue

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CSR\<15\>)

DONE 1 device done flag (CSR\<7\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR\<6\>)

STIME 24 seek time, per cylinder

RTIME 24 rotational delay

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

end of file x assume rest of disk is zero

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### RQDX3 MSCP Disk Controllers (RQ, RQB, RQC, RQD)

The simulator implements four MSCP disk controllers, RQ, RQB, RQC, RQD.
Initially, RQB, RQC, and RQD are disabled. Each RQ controller simulates
an RQDX3 MSCP disk controller with four drives. RQ options include the
ability to set units write enabled or write locked, and to set the drive
type to one of many disk types:

SET RQn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET RQn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

SET RQn RX50 set type to RX50

SET RQn RX33 set type to RX33

SET RQn RD32 set type to RD32

SET RQn RD51 set type to RD51

SET RQn RD52 set type to RD52

SET RQn RD53 set type to RD53

SET RQn RD54 set type to RD54

SET RQn RD31 set type to RD31

SET RQn RA80 set type to RA80

SET RQn RA81 set type to RA81

SET RQn RA82 set type to RA82

set RQn RA71 set type to RA71

SET RQn RA72 set type to RA72

SET RQn RA90 set type to RA90

SET RQn RA92 set type to RA92

SET RQn RRD40 set type to RRD40 (CD ROM)

SET RQn RAUSER{=n} set type to RA82 with n MB's

SET -L RQn RAUSER{=n} set type to RA82 with n LBN's

The type options can be used only when a unit is not attached to a file.
RAUSER is a "user specified" disk; the user can specify the size of the
disk in either MB (1000000 bytes) or logical block numbers (LBN's, 512
bytes each). The minimum size is 5MB; the maximum size is 2GB without
extended file support, 1TB with extended file support

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

Drive units have changeable unit numbers. Unit numbers can be changed
with:

SET RQn UNIT=val set unit plug value

Each device has 4 units which have unique MSCP unit numbers (0, 1, 2 and
3).

Each RQ controller implements the following special SHOW commands:

SHOW RQn TYPE show drive type

SHOW RQ RINGS show command and response rings

SHOW RQ FREEQ show packet free queue

SHOW RQ RESPQ show packet response queue

SHOW RQ UNITQ show unit queues

SHOW RQ ALL show all ring and queue state

SHOW RQn UNITQ show unit queues for unit n

SHOW RQn UNIT show unit plug value

Each RQ controller implements these registers:

name size comments

SA 16 status/address register

S1DAT 16 step 1 init host data

CQBA 22 command queue base address

CQLNT 8 command queue length

CQIDX 8 command queue index

RQBA 22 request queue base address

RQLNT 8 request queue length

RQIDX 8 request queue index

FREE 5 head of free packet list

## Communications Devices

### DZV11 Terminal Multiplexer (DZ)

The DZV11 is a 4-line terminal multiplexor. Up to 4 DZ11's (16 lines)
are supported. The number of lines can be changed with the command

SET DZ LINES=n set line count to n

The line count must be a multiple of 4, with a maximum of 16.

The DZ11 supports three character processing modes, 7P, 7B, and 8B:

mode input characters output characters

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default is 8B.

The DZV11 supports logging on a per-line basis. The command

SET DZ LOG=line=filename

enables logging for the specified line to the indicated file. The
command

SET DZ NOLOG=line

disables logging for the specified line and closes any open log file.
Finally, the command

SHOW DZ LOG

displays logging information for all DZ lines.

The terminal lines perform input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command specifies the
port to be used:

ATTACH {-am} DZ \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. The optional switch -m turns on the
DZV11's modem controls; the optional switch -a turns on active
disconnects (disconnect session if computer clears Data Terminal Ready).
Without modem control, the DZV11 behaves as though terminals were
directly connected; disconnecting the Telnet session does not cause any
operating system-visible change in line status.

Once the DZ is attached and the simulator is running, the DZ will listen
for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connection remains open until
disconnected by the simulated program, the Telnet client, a SET DZ
DISCONNECT command, or a DETACH DZ command.

Other special DZ commands:

> SHOW DZ CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW DZ STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET DZ DISCONNECT=linenumber disconnects the specified line.

The DZV11 implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR\[0:3\] 16 control/status register, boards 0 to 3

RBUF\[0:3\] 16 receive buffer, boards 0 to 3

LPR\[0:3\] 16 line parameter register, boards 0 to 3

TCR\[0:3\] 16 transmission control register, boards 0 to 3

MSR\[0:3\] 16 modem status register, boards 0 to 3

TDR\[0:3\] 16 transmit data register, boards 0 to 3

SAENB\[0:3\] 1 silo alarm enabled, boards 0 to 3

RXINT 4 receive interrupts, boards 3 to 0

TXINT 4 transmit interrupts, boards 3 to 0

MDMTCL 1 modem control enabled

AUTODS 1 autodisconnect enabled

The DZV11 partially supports save and restore. A save simulator state
will restore the listening sockets and serial port parameters, but all
active incoming telnet connections will be lost.

All active incoming telnet connections are lost when the simulator shuts
down or the DZ is detached.

### DHQ11 Terminal Multiplexer (VH)

The DHQ11 is an 8-line terminal multiplexer for Qbus systems. Up to 4
DHQ11's are supported.

The DHQ11 is a programmable asynchronous terminal multiplexer. It has
two programming modes: DHV11 and DHU11. The register sets are compatible
with these devices. For transmission, the DHQ11 can be used in either
DMA or programmed I/O mode. For reception, there is a 256-entry FIFO for
received characters, dataset status changes, and diagnostic information,
and a programmable input interrupt timer (in DHU mode). The device
supports 16-, 18-, and 22-bit addressing. The DHQ11 can be programmed to
filter and/or handle XON/XOFF characters independently of the processor.
The DHQ11 supports programmable bit width (between 5 and 8) for the
input and output of characters.

The DHQ11 has a rocker switch for determining the programming mode. By
default, the DHV11 mode is selected, though DHU11 mode is recommended
for applications that can support it. The VH controller may be adjusted
on a per controller basis as follows:

SET VHn DHU use the DHU programming mode and registers

SET VHn DHV use the DHV programming mode and registers

DMA output is supported. In a real DHQ11, DMA is not initiated
immediately upon receipt of TX.DMA.START but is dependent upon some
internal processes. The VH controller mimics this behavior by default.
It may be desirable to alter this and start immediately, though this may
not be compatible with all operating systems and diagnostics. You can
change the behavior of the VH controller as follows:

SET VHn NORMAL use normal DMA procedures

SET VHn FASTDMA set DMA to initiate immediately

The terminal lines perform input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command specifies the
port to be used:

ATTACH VH \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. This port is the point of entry for
all lines on all VH controllers.

The number of lines can be changed with the command

SET VH LINES=n set line count to n

The line count must be a multiple of 8, with a maximum of 32.

Modem and auto-disconnect support may be set on an individual controller
basis. The SET MODEM command directs the controller to report modem
status changes to the computer. The SET HANGUP command turns on active
disconnects (disconnect session if computer clears Data Terminal Ready).

SET VHn \[NO\]MODEM disable/enable modem control

SET VHn \[NO\]HANGUP disable/enable disconnect on DTR drop

Once the VH is attached and the simulator is running, the VH will listen
for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connection remains open until
disconnected by the simulated program, the Telnet client, a SET VH
DISCONNECT command, or a DETACH VH command.

Other special VH commands:

> SHOW VH CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW VH STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET VH DISCONNECT=linenumber disconnects the specified line.

The DHQ11 implements these registers, though not all can be examined
from SCP:

name size comments

CSR\[0:3\] 16 control/status register, boards 0 to 3

RBUF\[0:3\] 16 receive buffer, boards 0 to 3

LPR\[0:3\] 16 line parameter register, boards 0 to 3

RXINT 4 receive interrupts, boards 3..0

TXINT 4 transmit interrupts, boards 3..0

\[more to be described...\]

The DHQ11 does not support save and restore. All open connections are
lost when the simulator shuts down or the VH is detached.

### DELQA-T/DELQA/DEQNA Qbus Ethernet Controllers (XQ, XQB)

The simulator implements two DELQA-T/DELQA/DEQNA Qbus Ethernet
controllers (XQ, XQB). Initially, XQ is enabled, and XQB is disabled.
Options allow control of the MAC address, the controller mode, and the
sanity timer.

SET XQ MAC=\<mac-address\> ex. 08-00-2B-AA-BB-CC

SHOW XQ MAC

These commands are used to change or display the MAC address.
\<mac-address\> is a valid Ethernet MAC, delimited by dashes or periods.
The controller defaults to 08-00-2B-AA-BB-CC, which should be sufficient
if there is only one SIMH controller on your LAN. Two cards with the
same MAC address will see each other's packets, resulting in a serious
mess.

SET XQ TYPE={DEQNA|\[DELQA\]|DELQA-T}

SHOW XQ TYPE

These commands are used to change or display the controller mode. DELQA
mode is better and faster but may not be usable by older or non-DEC
OS's. Also, be aware that DEQNA mode is not supported by many modern
OS's. The DEQNA-LOCK mode of the DELQA card is emulated by setting the
the controller to DEQNA -- there is no need for a separate mode.
DEQNA-LOCK mode behaves exactly like a DEQNA, except for the operation
of the VAR and MOP processing.

SET XQ SANITY={ON|\[OFF\]}

SHOW XQ SANITY

These commands change or display the INITIALIZATION sanity timer (DEQNA
jumper W3/DELQA switch S4). The INITIALIZATION sanity timer has a
default timeout of 4 minutes, and cannot be turned off, just reset. The
normal sanity timer can be set by operating system software regardless
of the state of this switch. Note that only the DEQNA (or the DELQA in
DEQNA-LOCK mode (=DEQNA)) supports the sanity timer -- it is ignored by
a DELQA in Normal mode, which uses switch S4 for a different purpose.

SET XQ POLL={DEFAULT|4..2500}

SHOW XQ POLL

These commands change or display the service polling timer. The polling
timer is calibrated to run the service thread 200 times per second. This
value can be changed to accommodate particular system requirements for
more (or less) frequent polling.

SHOW XQ STATS

This command will display the accumulated statistics for the simulated
Ethernet controller.

To access the network, the simulated Ethernet controller must be
attached

to a real Ethernet interface:

ATTACH XQ0 {ethX|\<device\_name\>} ex. eth0 or /dev/era0

SHOW XQ ETH

where X in 'ethX' is the number of the Ethernet controller to attach, or
the real device name. The X number is system-dependant. If you only have
one Ethernet controller, the number will probably be 0. To find out what
your system thinks the Ethernet numbers are, use the SHOW XQ ETH
command. The device list can be quite cryptic, depending on the host
system, but is probably better than guessing. If you do not attach the
device, the controller will behave as though the Ethernet cable were
unplugged.

XQ and XQB have the following registers:

name size comments

SA0 16 station address word 0

SA1 16 station address word 1

SA2 16 station address word 2

SA3 16 station address word 3

SA4 16 station address word 4

SA5 16 station address word 5

RBDL 32 receive buffer descriptor list

XBDL 32 trans(X)mit buffer descriptor list

CSR 16 control status register

VAR 16 vector address register

INT 1 interrupt request flag

One final note: because of its asynchronous nature, the XQ controller is
not limited to the \~1.5Mbit/sec of the real DEQNA/DELQA controllers,
nor the 10Mbit/sec of a standard Ethernet. Attach it to a Fast Ethernet
(100 Mbit/sec) card, and "Feel the Power\!" :-)

## CR11 Card Reader (CR)

The card reader (CR) implements a single controller (the CR11) and card
reader (e.g., Documation M200, GDI Model 100) by reading a file and
presenting lines or cards to the simulator. Card decks may be
represented by plain text ASCII files, card image files, or column
binary files. The CR11 controller is also compatible with the CM11-F,
CME11, and CMS11.

Card image files are a file format designed by Douglas W. Jones at the
University of Iowa to support the interchange of card deck data. These
files have a much richer information carrying capacity than plain ASCII
files. Card Image files can contain such interchange information as
card-stock color, corner cuts, special artwork, as well as the binary
punch data representing all 12 columns. Complete details on the format,
as well as sample code, are available at Prof. Jones's site:
http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/\~jones/cards/.

Examples of the CR11 include the M8290 and M8291 (CMS11). All card
readers use a common vector at 0230 and CSR at 177160. Even though the
CR11 is normally configured as a BR6 device, it is configured for BR4 in
this simulation.

The card reader supports ASCII, card image, and column binary format
card “decks.” When reading plain ASCII files, lines longer than 80
characters are silently truncated. Card image support is included for 80
column Hollerith, 82 column Hollerith (silently ignoring columns 0 and
81), and 40 column Hollerith (mark-sense) cards. Column binary supports
80 column card images only. All files are attached read-only (as if the
-R switch were given).

ATTACH –A CR \<file\> file is ASCII text

ATTACH –B CR \<file\> file is column binary

ATTACH –I CR \<file\> file is card image format

If no flags are given, the file extension is evaluated. If the filename
ends in .TXT, the file is treated as ASCII text. If the filename ends in
.CBN, the file is treated as column binary. Otherwise, the CR driver
looks for a card image header. If a correct header is found the file is
treated as card image format, otherwise it is treated as ASCII text.

The correct character translation MUST be set if a plain text file is to
be used for card deck input. The correct translation SHOULD be set to
allow correct ASCII debugging of a card image or column binary input
deck. Depending upon the operating system in use, how it was generated,
and how the card data will be read and used, the translation must be set
correctly so that the proper character set is used by the driver. Use
the following command to explicitly set the correct translation:

SET TRANSLATION={DEFAULT|026|026FTN|029|EBCDIC}

This command should be given after a deck is attached to the simulator.
The mappings above are completely described at
http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/\~jones/cards/codes.html. Note that DEC
typically used 029 or 026FTN mappings.

DEC operating systems used a variety of methods to determine the end of
a deck (recognizing that 'hopper empty' does not necessarily mean the
end of a deck. Below is a summary of the various operating system
conventions for signaling end of deck:

RT-11: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

RSTS/E: 12-11-0-1 or 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

RSX: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch

VMS: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in first 8 columns

TOPS: 12-11-0-1 or 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

Using the AUTOEOF setting, the card reader can be set to automatically
generate an EOF card consisting of the 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in
columns 1-8. When set to CD11 mode, this switch also enables automatic
setting of the EOF bit in the controller after the EOF card has been
processed. \[The CR11 does not have a similar capability.\] By default
AUTOEOF is enabled.

SET CR AUTOEOF

SET CR NOAUTOEOF

The default card reader rate for the CR11 is 285 cpm. The reader rate
can be set to its default value or to anywhere in the range 200..1200
cpm. This rate may be changed while the unit is attached.

SET CR RATE={DEFAULT|200..1200}

It is standard operating procedure for operators to load a card deck and
press the momentary action RESET button to clear any error conditions
and alert the processor that a deck is available to read. Use the
following command to simulate pressing the card reader RESET button,

SET CR RESET

Another common control of physical card readers is the STOP button. An
operator could use this button to finish the read operation for the
current card and terminate reading a deck early. Use the following
command to simulate pressing the card reader STOP button.

SET CR STOP

The simulator does not support the BOOT command. The simulator does not
stop on file I/O errors. Instead the controller signals a reader check
to the CPU.

The CR controller implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 ASCII value of last column processed

CRS 16 CR11 status register

CRB1 16 CR11 12-bit Hollerith character

CRB2 16 CR11 8-bit compressed character

CRM 16 CR11 maintenance register

CDST 16 CD11 control/status register

CDCC 16 CD11 column count

CDBA 16 CD11 current bus address

CDDB 16 CD11 data buffer, 2nd status

BLOWER 2 blower state value

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CRS\<15\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CRS\<6\>)

POS 32 file position - do not alter

TIME 24 delay time between columns

# Symbolic Display and Input

The VAX simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

\-a,-c display as ASCII data

\-m display instruction mnemonics

\-p display compatibility mode mnemonics

\-r display RADIX50 encoding

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

' or -a ASCII characters (determined by length)

" or -c ASCII string (maximum 60 characters)

\-p compatibility mode instruction mnemonic

alphabetic instruction mnemonic

numeric octal number

VAX instruction input uses standard VAX assembler syntax. Compatibility
mode instruction input uses standard PDP-11 assembler syntax.

The syntax for VAX specifiers is as follows:

syntax specifier displacement comments

\#s^n, \#n 0n - short literal, integer only

\[Rn\] 4n - indexed, second specifier follows

Rn 5n - PC illegal

(Rn) 6n - PC illegal

\-(Rn) 7n - PC illegal

(Rn)+ 8n -

\#i^n, \#n 8F n immediate

@(Rn)+ 9n -

@\#addr 9F addr absolute

{+/-}b^d(Rn) An {+/-}d byte displacement

b^d AF d - PC byte PC relative

@{+/-}b^d(Rn) Bn {+/-}d byte displacement deferred

@b^d BF d - PC byte PC relative deferred

{+/-}w^d(Rn) Cn {+/-}d word displacement

w^d CF d - PC word PC relative

@{+/-}w^d(Rn) Dn {+/-}d word displacement deferred

@w^d DF d - PC word PC relative deferred

{+/-}l^d(Rn) En {+/-}d long displacement

l^d EF d - PC long PC relative

@{+/-}l^d(Rn) Fn {+/-}d long displacement deferred

@l^d FF d - PC long PC relative deferred

If no override is given for a literal (s^ or i^) or for a displacement
or PC relative address (b^, w^, or l^), the simulator chooses the mode
automatically.

# Appendix - The KA655"X"

The real KA655 is limited to 64MB of memory, and the KA655 firmware is
coded to this limit. However, the VAX operating systems (VMS, Ultrix,
NetBSD) know very little about the hardware details. Instead, they take
their memory size information from the Restart Parameter Block (RPB). If
the firmware sets up an RPB for more than 64MB, the operating systems
use the extra memory without requiring source changes.

If more than 64MB of memory is configured, the simulator implements an
18th CMCTL register. This read-only register gives the size of main
memory in MB. The console firmware (ka655x.bin) uses this to set up the
RPB. Other parts of the firmware are generally unaware of extended
memory; thus, all the diagnostic commands operate only on the first 64MB
of memory. However SHOW MEM will display the total amount of memory the
simulator is configured with

If 64MB or less of memory is configured, the 18th CMCTL register is
invisible, and the simulator operates like a real KA655.
