# Introduction

This memorandum documents the SIMH simulators. These simulators are
freeware; refer to the license terms above for conditions of use.
Support is not available. The best way to fix problems or add features
is to read and modify the sources yourself. Alternately, you can send
Internet mail to simh AT trailing-edge DOT com, but a response is not
guaranteed.

The simulators use a common command interface. This memorandum describes
the features of the command interface. The details of each simulator are
documented in separate, machine-specific memoranda.

# Running A Simulator

To start the simulator, simply type its name. (On VMS the simulators
must then be defined as foreign commands in order to be started by
name.) The simulator recognizes three command line switches: -q, -v, and
-e. If -q is specified, certain informational messages are suppressed.
The -v and -e switches pertain only to command files and are described
in Section 3.13.

The simulator interprets the arguments on the command line, if any, as
the file name and arguments for a DO command:

% pdp10 {switches} {\<startup file\> {arg,arg,...}}

If no file is specified on the command line, the simulator looks for a
startup file consisting of the simulator name (including its path
components) plus the extension .ini. If a startup file is specified,
either on the command line or implicitly via the .ini capability, it
should contain a series of non-interactive simulator command, one per
line. These commands can be used to set up standard parameters, for
example, disk sizes.

After initializing its internal structures and processing the startup
file (if any), the simulator types out its name and version and then
prompts for input with:

sim\>

# Compiling A Simulator

The simulators have been tested on VAX VMS, Alpha VMS, IA64 VMS, Alpha
UNIX, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, Solaris, Windows
9x/NT/2000/XP/Win7/Win8, MacOS X, and OS/2. Porting to other
environments will require changes to the operating system dependent code
in the SIMH libraries (sim\_fio.c, sim\_timer.c, sim\_console.c,
sim\_ether.c, sim\_sock.c, sim\_disk.c, sim\_serial.c).

The simulator sources are provided in a zip archive and are organized
hierarchically. Source files for the simulator framework components are
in the top level directory; source files for each simulator are in
individual subdirectories. Note that the include files in the top level
directory are referenced from the subdirectories, without path
identifiers. Your build tool needs to search the top level directory for
include files not present in the simulator-specific directory. File
manifests for each simulator are given in that simulator's
documentation.

The simulators recognize or require a few compile-time \#defines:

  - > The 18b simulators require that the model name be defined as part
    > of the compilation command line (i.e., PDP4 for the PDP-4, PDP7
    > for the PDP-7, PDP9 for the PDP-9, PDP15 for the PDP-15).

  - > The PDP-10 and IBM 7094 simulators use 64b integer variables,
    > requiring that USE\_INT64 be defined as part of the compilation
    > command line. Since 64b integer declarations vary, sim\_defs.h has
    > conditional declarations for Windows (\_int64) and Digital UNIX
    > (long). The default is GNU C (long long). If your compiler uses a
    > different convention, you will have to modify sim\_defs.h.

  - > The PDP-10, PDP-11, and VAX simulators share common peripherals.
    > To distinguish the target system, one of three variables must be
    > defined on the command line: VM\_PDP10 for the PDP-10; VM\_PDP11
    > for the PDP-11; or VM\_VAX for the VAX.

  - > The PDP-11, and VAX simulators optionally support Ethernet. At
    > present, Ethernet support has been tested only on Windows, Linux,
    > OSX, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, Alpha and IA64 VMS, but it
    > should work in any host environment that supports the Pcap library
    > (see the Ethernet readme file).

  - > The PDP-11 and VAX simulators support disks and sequential tape
    > files greater than 2GB when the host OS is capable of manipulating
    > files greater than 2GB.

<!-- end list -->

  - The HP2100 Fast FORTRAN Processor (FFP) and 1000-F CPU options
    require 64b integer support. Define HAVE\_INT64 (not USE\_INT64) as
    part of the compilation command line if your host compiler supports
    64b integers. On systems without 64b support, the 1000 F-Series CPU
    will be unavailable, and FFP extended-precision instructions (e.g.,
    XADD) will be disabled; the remainder of the FFP instructions will
    work normally. There may be some compilation warnings.

## Compiling Under UNIX/Linux/Mac OS-X

The sources originate on a Windows system and have CR-LF line endings.
For use on other systems, the sources may need to be converted to LF
line endings. This can be done with the UNZIP utility (unzip -a).

The supplied makefile will compile the simulators for UNIX and Unix like
systems. The VAX and PDP-11 can be compiled with or without Ethernet
support. The makefile will automatically build these simulators with
Ethernet support if the necessary network components are available on
the system which is doing the building. The recommended libpcap
components are those packaged and provided by the host operating system
vendor. Specific details about building with network support is
documented in the 0readme\_ethernet.txt in the top level directory of
the simh source.

To compile with or without Ethernet support:

gmake {target|ALL|clean}

Notes for hand compilation:

  - > The default UNIX terminal handling model is the POSIX TERMIOS
    > interface, which is supported by Linux, Mac OS/X, and Alpha UNIX.
    > If your UNIX only supports the BSD terminal interface, BSDTTY must
    > be defined as part of the compilation command line.

  - > The PDP-8, PDP-11, 18b PDP, PDP-10, and Nova simulators use the
    > math library. If your UNIX does not link the math library
    > automatically, you must add -lm to the compilation command line.

Examples:

  - > PDP-11 under TERMIOS UNIX:

> % cc -DVM\_PDP11 pdp11\_\*.c scp.c sim\_\*.c -lm -o pdp11

  - > PDP-9 under TERMIOS UNIX:

> % cc -DPDP9 pdp18b\_\*.c scp.c sim\_\*.c -lm -o pdp9

  - > PDP-10 under BSD terminal UNIX:

> % cc -DVM\_PDP10 -DUSE\_INT64 -DBSDTTY pdp10\_\*.c scp.c sim\_\*.c -lm
> -o pdp10

## Compiling Under Windows

### Compiling with Ethernet Support

The Windows-specific Ethernet code uses the npcap or the WinPCAP 4.x
package. These packages provides the libpcap functionality package that
is freely available for Unix systems. Building simulators with built-in
Ethernet support can be done if the required npcap/WinPcap components
are available on your build system at compile time. These components are
available by downloading the file:

<https://github.com/simh/windows-build/archive/windows-build.zip>

This zip file contains a file called README.md which explains how to
locate the unpacked zip file contents to build simulators with Ethernet
support. If your build environment has git, the build activity will
automatically download the windows-build components the first time you
build a simulator.

In order for a simulator (built with Ethernet support) to provide
working Ethernet functionality at run time, npcap WinPCAP must be
installed on the system. In order to install the npcap or WinPcap
package the following should be performed:

  - > Download npcap from https://npcap.com/\#download or WinPcap
    > http://www.winpcap.org.

  - > Install the package as directed.

### Compiling Under Visual C++

Visual C++ requires projects to be defined for each executable which is
being built. You can define your own project for each simulator you are
interested in, or you can use the predefined project definitions for
this simulator release.

#### Using the predefined project definitions

The current simh source includes a directory “Visual Studio Projects”
which contains the visual studio projects for all supported simulators.
This directory contains a file named 0ReadMe\_Projects.txt which
explains how to locate simh source files with respect to the related
required build components provide in the windows\_build.zip file
mentioned above in “Compiling with Ethernet Support”.

These projects produce executables in the BIN\\NT\\Win32-Debug or
BIN\\NT\\Win32-Release directories. All intermediate build files are
kept in BIN\\NT\\Project\\{simulator-name} directories.

#### Defining your own Visual C++ project definitions

Each simulator must be organized as a separate Visual C++ project.
Starting from an empty console application,

  - Add all the files from the simulator file manifest to the project.

  - Open the Properties (Visual Studio Express 2008) box.

  - Under C/C++, Category: General, add any required preprocessor
    definitions (for example, USE\_INT64).

  - Under C/C++, Category: Preprocessor, add the top level simulation
    directory to the Additional Include Directories. For the VAX and
    PDP-10, you must also add the PDP-11 directory.

  - Under Link, add wsock32.lib and winmm.lib at the end of the list of
    Object/Module Libraries.

  - If you are building the PDP-11 and VAX with Ethernet support, you
    must also add the WinPCAP libraries (packet.lib, wpcap.lib) to the
    list of Object/Module libraries.

If you are using Visual C++ .NET, you must turn off /Wp64 (warn about
potential 64b incompatibilities) and disable Unicode processing. You
will also have to turn off warning 4996 (“deprecated” string functions),
or lower the warning level to /W1. Otherwise, the compilations will
generate a lot of spurious conversion warnings.

Alternatively, you can ‘start’ from a preexisting Visual Studio project
which may have similar components to the project you are trying to
create. Starting from such a project is done by copying the existing
.vcproj file to a project file with a new name. The MOST IMPORTANT step
of this process is to assure that the copy of the project file has a
unique GUID. Generate a new GUID by invoking the guidgen.exe program
from the Visual Studio directories (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft
Visual Studio 9.0\\Common7\\Tools\\guidgen.exe). Click on the Copy
button to get the newly generated GUID into the clipboard. Open the
target project file in a text editor (notepad) and replace the
ProjectGUID value with the clipboard contents. Replace the Name value
(PDP1 for example) with the name of your new simulator. Carefully do a
global replace of all instances of the prior Name value (PDP1 in this
case) with the name of your new simulator. Save the project file. The
next step is to add the project file to the existing simh solution. Open
the simh.sln with visual studio and in the Solution Explorer pane, right
click on the Solution Simh and select Add-\>Existing Project. Browse and
select your new project file. All other changes to the project file (the
particular source and include files which make up your simulator) can be
added or adjusted here.

### Compiling Under MinGW

MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) is a free C compiler available from
http://www.mingw.org. Msys is a minimal set of Unix utilities to support
MinGW, also available from
[http://www.mingw.org](http://www.mingw.org/). The distribution includes
a batch file (build\_mingw.bat) that will build all the simulators from
source. By default, the PDP-11 and VAX family simulators are built with
Ethernet support if the necessary Winpcap components are available at
build time. The compiled executables will be produced in the BIN
directory which will be created if needed.

## Compiling Under OpenVMS

Compiling on OpenVMS requires DEC C. The simulators that require 64b
(PDP-10, VAX and others) will not compile on OpenVMS/VAX. The SIMH
distribution includes an MMS command file descrip.mms that will build
all the simulators from source. An example of hand compilation:

  - > PDP-8 under VMS:

> $ cc scp.c,sim\_\*.c,\[.pdp8\]pdp8\*.c
> 
> $ link/exec=pdp8 scp.obj,sim\_\*.obj,\[.pdp8\]pdp8\*.obj

# Simulator Conventions

A simulator consists of a series of devices, the first of which is
always the CPU. A device consists of named registers and one or more
numbered units. Registers correspond to device state, units to device
address spaces. Thus, the CPU device might have registers like PC, ION,
etc., and a unit corresponding to main memory; a disk device might have
registers like BUSY, DONE, etc., and units corresponding to individual
disk drives. Except for main memory, device address spaces are simulated
as unstructured binary disk files in the host file system. The SHOW
CONFIG command displays the simulator configuration.

A simulator keeps time in terms of arbitrary units, usually one time
unit per instruction executed. Simulated events (such as completion of
I/O) are scheduled at some number of time units in the future. The
simulator executes synchronously, invoking event processors when
simulated events are scheduled to occur. Even asynchronous events, like
keyboard input, are handled by polling at synchronous intervals. The
SHOW QUEUE command displays the simulator event queue.

# Commands

Simulator commands consist of a command verb, optional switches, and
optional arguments. Switches take the form:

\-\<letter\>{\<letter\>...}

Multiple switches may be specified separately or together: -abcd and -a
-b -c -d are treated identically. Verbs, switches, and other input
(except for file names) are case insensitive.

Any command beginning with semicolon (;) is considered a comment and
ignored.

## Loading and Saving Programs

The LOAD command (abbreviation LO) loads a file in binary loader format:

load \<filename\> {implementation options}

The types of formats supported are simulator specific. Options (such as
load within range) are also simulator specific. The load command may not
be meaningful or supported at all in some simulators.

The DUMP command (abbreviation DU) dumps memory in binary loader format:

dump \<filename\> {implementation options}

The types of formats supported are simulator specific. Options (such as
dump within range) are also simulator specific. The dump command may not
be meaningful or supported at all in some simulators.

## Saving and Restoring State

The SAVE command (abbreviation SA) save the complete state of the
simulator to a file. This includes the contents of main memory and all
registers, and the I/O connections of devices:

save \<filename\>

The RESTORE command (abbreviation REST, alternately GET) restores a
previously saved simulator state:

restore {-d} {-f} {-q} \<filename\>

Notes:

1)  SAVE file format compresses zeroes to minimize file size.

2)  The simulator can’t restore active incoming telnet sessions to
    multiplexer devices, but the listening ports will be restored across
    a save/restore.

3)  –d switch avoids detaching and reattaching devices during a restore

4)  –f switch overrides the date timestamp check for attached files
    during a restore

5)  –q suppresses warning messages about save file version information

## Resetting Devices

The RESET command (abbreviation RE) resets a device or the entire
simulator to a predefined condition. If switch -p is specified, the
device is reset to its power-up state:

RESET reset all devices

RESET -p powerup all devices

RESET ALL reset all devices

RESET \<device\> reset specified device

Typically, RESET stops any in-progress I/O operation, clears any
interrupt request, and returns the device to a quiescent state. It does
not clear main memory or affect I/O connections.

## Connecting and Disconnecting Devices

Except for main memory and network devices, units are simulated as
unstructured binary disk files in the host file system. Before using a
simulated unit, the user must specify the file to be accessed by that
unit. The ATTACH (abbreviation AT) command associates a unit and a file:

ATTACH \<unit\> \<filename\>

If the -n switch is specified when an attach is executed, a new file is
created, and an appropriate message is printed.

If the file does not exist, and the -e switch was not specified, a new
file is created, and an appropriate message is printed. If the -e switch
was specified, a new file is not created, and an error message is
printed. If the –n switch was specified, a new file is created or the
existing file is truncated to zero length.

If the -r switch is specified, or the file is write protected, ATTACH
tries to open the file read only. If the file does not exist, or the
unit does not support read only operation, an error occurs. Input-only
devices, such as paper-tape readers, and devices with write lock
switches, such as disks and tapes, support read only operation; other
devices do not. If a file is attached read only, its contents can be
examined but not modified.

If the –a switch is specified, is a sequential output only device (like
a line printer, paper tape punch, etc.), the file being attached will be
opened in append mode thus adding to any existing file data beyond what
may have already been there.

For simulated magnetic tapes, the ATTACH command can specify the format
of the attached tape image file:

ATTACH -f \<tape\_unit\> \<format\> \<filename\>

The currently supported tape image file formats are:

SIMH SIMH simulator format

E11 E11 simulator format

TPC TPC format

P7B Pierce simulator 7-track format

The tape format can also be set with the SET command prior to ATTACH:

SET \<tape\_unit\> FORMAT=\<format\>

ATT \<tape\_unit\> \<filename\>

The format of an attached file can be displayed with the SHOW command:

SHOW \<tape\_unit\> FORMAT

For Telnet-based terminal emulators, the ATTACH command associates the
master unit with a TCP/IP port:

ATTACH \<unit\> \<port\>

The port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not used by
standard TCP/IP protocols.

For Ethernet emulators, the ATTACH command associates the simulated
Ethernet with a physical Ethernet device:

ATTACH \<unit\> \<physical device name\>

The DETACH (abbreviation DET) command breaks the association between a
unit and a file, port, or network device:

DETACH ALL detach all units

DETACH \<unit\> detach specified unit

The EXIT command performs an automatic DETACH ALL.

## Examining and Changing State

There are four commands to examine and change state:

  - > EXAMINE (abbreviated E) examines state

  - > DEPOSIT (abbreviated D) changes state

  - > IEXAMINE (interactive examine, abbreviated IE) examines state and
    > allows the user to interactively change it

  - > IDEPOSIT (interactive deposit, abbreviated ID) allows the user to
    > interactively change state

All four commands take the form

command {modifiers} \<object list\>

Deposit must also include a deposit value at the end of the command.

There are four kinds of modifiers: switches, device/unit name, search
specifier, and for EXAMINE, output file. Switches have been described
previously. A device/unit name identifies the device and unit whose
address space is to be examined or modified. If no device is specified,
the CPU (main memory)is selected; if a device but no unit is specified,
unit 0 of the device is selected.

The search specifier provides criteria for testing addresses or
registers to see if they should be processed. A specifier consists of a
logical operator, a relational operator, or both, optionally separated
by spaces.

{\<logical op\> \<value\>} \<relational op\> \<value\>

where the logical operator is & (and), | (or), or ^ (exclusive or), and
the relational operator is = or == (equal), \! or \!= (not equal), \>=
(greater than or equal), \> (greater than), \<= (less than or equal), or
\< (less than). If a logical operator is specified without a relational
operator, it is ignored. If a relational operator is specified without a
logical operator, no logical operation is performed. All comparisons are
unsigned.

The output file modifier redirects command output to a file instead of
the console. An output file modifier consists of @ followed by a valid
file name.

Modifiers may be specified in any order. If multiple modifiers of the
same type are specified, later modifiers override earlier modifiers.
Note that if the device/unit name comes after the search specifier, the
search values will interpreted in the radix of the CPU, rather than of
the device/unit.

The "object list" consists of one or more of the following, separated by
commas:

register the specified register

register\[sub1-sub2\] the specified register array locations,

starting at location sub1 up to and

including location sub2

register\[sub1/length\] the specified register array locations,

starting at location sub1 up to but

not including sub1+length

register\[ALL\] all locations in the specified register

array

register1-register2 all the registers starting at register1

up to and including register2

address the specified location

address1-address2 all locations starting at address1 up to

and including address2

address/length all location starting at address up to

but not including address+length

STATE all registers in the device

ALL all locations in the unit

$ use the most recently referenced value as

an address to reference (indirect)

. use the most recent referenced address

again.

Switches can be used to control the format of display information:

\-o or -8 display as octal

\-d or -10 display as decimal

\-h or -16 display as hexadecimal

\-2 display as binary

Simulators typically provide these additional switches for address
locations:

\-a display as ASCII

\-c display as character string

\-m display as instruction mnemonic

...and accept symbolic input (see documentation with each simulator).

Examples:

ex 1000-1100 examine 1000 to 1100

ex . examine most recent address again

de PC 1040 set PC to 1040

ie 40-50 interactively examine 40:50

ie \>1000 40-50 interactively examine the subset

of locations 40:50 that are \>1000

ex rx0 50060 examine 50060, RX unit 0

ex rx sbuf\[3-6\] examine SBUF\[3\] to SBUF\[6\] in RX

ex r4,$ examine R4 and where it points

de all 0 set main memory to 0

de &77\>0 0 set all addresses whose low order

bits are non-zero to 0

ex -m @memdump.txt 0-7777 dump memory to file

Note: to terminate an interactive command, simply type a bad value (eg,
XYZ) when input is requested.

## Evaluating Instructions

The EVAL command evaluates a symbolic instruction and returns the
equivalent numeric value. This is useful for obtaining numeric arguments
for a search command:

EVAL \<expression\>

Examples:

On the VAX simulator:

sim\> eval addl2 r2,r3

0: 005352C0

sim\> eval addl2 \#ff,6(r0)

0: 00FF8FC0

4: 06A00000

sim\> eval 'AB

0: 00004241

On the PDP-8:

sim\> eval tad 60

0: 1060

sim\> eval tad 300

tad 300

Can't be parsed as an instruction or data

'tad 300' fails, because with an implicit PC of 0, location 300 can't be

reached with direct addressing.

## Running a Simulated Program

The RUN command (abbreviated RU) resets all devices, deposits its
argument (if given) in the PC, and starts execution. If no argument is
given, execution starts at the current PC.

The GO command does *not* reset devices, deposits its argument (if
given) in the PC, and starts execution. If no argument is given,
execution starts at the current PC.

The CONTINUE command (abbreviated CO) does *not* reset devices and
resumes execution at the current PC.

The STEP command (abbreviated S) resumes execution at the current PC for
the number of instructions given by its argument. If no argument is
supplied, one instruction is executed.

The BOOT command (abbreviated B) resets all devices and bootstraps the
device and unit given by its argument. If no unit is supplied, unit 0 is
bootstrapped. The specified unit must be attached.

As it initializes all of the I/O devices, the RUN command is almost
never the proper command to use after a program has been started. The GO
or CONTINUE commands are generally equivalent in hardware to running the
CPU and is the usual way of resuming execution after a programmed halt.
If an I/O reset is required before resuming execution, the RESET and GO
commands are recommended instead of RUN. If RUN is entered a second time
without an explicit RESET preceding it, a warning is printed on the
simulation console:

Resetting all devices... This may not have been your intention.

The GO and CONTINUE commands do not reset devices.

...before execution is resumed. The warning may be suppressed by adding
the –Q switch to the RUN command.

### Controlling the Simulation Rate

By default, the simulator runs as fast as possible (although at lower
than normal priority) and will consume all available processing
resources on the host system. This will raise power consumption (and the
operating temperature) of many PC’s and drain the battery of a laptop.

The SET THROTTLE command allows the user to reduce the effective
execution rate to a specified number of instructions per second, or to a
specified percentage of total host computing time:

SET THROTTLE xM set execution rate to x mips

SET THROTTLE xK set execution rate to x kips

SET THROTTLE x% limit simulator to x% of host time

SET THROTTLE insts/delay execute ‘insts’ instructions and

> then sleep for ‘delay’ milliseconds

Throttling is only available on host systems that implement a precision
real-time delay function.

xM, xK and x% modes require the simulator to execute sufficient
instructions to actually calibrate the desired execution rate relative
to wall clock time. Very short running programs may complete before
calibration completes and therefore before the simulated execution rate
can match the desired rate.

The SET NOTHROTTLE command turns off throttling. The SHOW THROTTLE
command shows the current settings for throttling.

Some simulators implement a different form of resource management called
idling. Idling suspends simulated execution whenever the program running
on the simulator is doing nothing, and runs the simulator at full speed
when there is work to do. Throttling and idling are mutually exclusive.

## Stopping the Simulator

Programs run until the simulator detects an error or stop condition, or
until the user forces a stop condition.

### Simulator Detected Stop Conditions

These simulator-detected conditions stop simulation:

  - HALT instruction. If a HALT instruction is decoded, simulation
    stops.

  - Breakpoint. The simulator may support breakpoints (see below).

  - I/O error. If an I/O error occurs during simulation of an I/O
    operation, and the device stop-on-I/O-error flag is set, simulation
    usually stops.

  - Processor condition. Certain processor conditions can stop
    simulation; these are described with the individual simulators.

### User Specified Stop Conditions

Typing the interrupt character stops simulation. The interrupt character
is defined by the WRU (where are you) console option and is initially
set to 005 (^E).

### Breakpoints

A simulator may offer breakpoint capability. A simulator may define
breakpoints of different types, identified by letter (for example, E for
execution, R for read, W for write, etc.). At the moment, most
simulators support only E (execution) breakpoints.

Associated with a breakpoint are a count and, optionally, one or more
actions. Each time the breakpoint is taken, the associated count is
decremented. If the count is less than or equal to 0, the breakpoint
occurs; otherwise, it is deferred. When the breakpoint occurs, the
optional actions are automatically executed.

A breakpoint is set by the BREAK command:

BREAK {-types} {\<addr range\>{\[count\]},{addr
range...}}{;action;action...}

If no type is specified, the simulator-specific default breakpoint type
(usually E for execution) is used. If no address range is specified, the
current PC is used. As with EXAMINE and DEPOSIT, an address range may be
a single address, a range of addresses low-high, or a relative range of
address/length. Examples:

BREAK set E break at current PC

BREAK -e 200 set E break at 200

BREAK 2000/2\[2\] set E breaks at 2000,2001 with count = 2

BREAK 100;EX AC;D MQ 0 set E break at 100 with actions EX AC and

> D MQ 0

BREAK 100; delete action on break at 100

Currently set breakpoints can be displayed with the SHOW BREAK command:

SHOW {-types} BREAK {ALL|\<addr range\>{,\<addr range\>...}}

Locations with breakpoints of the specified type are displayed.

Finally, breakpoints can be cleared by the NOBREAK command.

If an action command must contain a semicolon, that action command
should be enclosed in quotes so that the entire action command can be
distinguished from the action separator.

### Execution Time Limits

A simulator user may want to limit the maximum execution time that a
simulator may run for. This might be appropriate to limit a runaway
diagnostic which didn’t achieve explicit success or failure within some
user specified time. The RUNLIMIT command provides ways to limit
execution.

RUNLIMIT n {CYCLES|MICROSECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS}

NORUNLIMIT

Equivalently:

SET RUNLIMIT n {CYCLES|MICROSECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS}

SET NORUNLIMIT

The run limit state can be examined with:

SHOW RUNLIMIT

If the units of the run limit are not specified, the default units are
cycles. Once an execution run limit has been reached, any subsequent GO,
RUN, CONTINUE, STEP or BOOT commands will cause the simulator to exit. A
previously defined RUNLIMIT can be cleared with the NORUNLIMIT or the
establishment of a new limit.

## Halt on Output Data

In addition to breakpoints (halting the simulator on specific
addresses), the simulator can halt when a

specific string has been output to the console. The EXPECT command
provides a way to define a rule which will stop execution and take
actions when specific output has been generated by the simulated system.

EXPECT {dev:line} {\[count\]} {HALTAFTER=n,}”\<string\>” {actioncommand
{; actioncommand} …}

NOEXPECT {dev:line}

SHOW EXPECT {dev:line}

\<dev:line\> specifies a particular device a line in that simulated
device. If it is not specified, the simulated system’s console device is
the default device.

If a \[count\] is specified, the rule will match after the match string
has matched count times.

The string argument must be delimited by quote characters. Quotes may be
either single or double but the opening and closing quote characters
must match. Data in the string may contain escaped character strings.

When expect rules are defined, they are evaluated against recently
produced output as each character is output to the device. Since this
evaluation processing is done on each output character, rule matching is
not specifically line oriented. If line oriented matching is desired,
then rules should be defined which contain the simulated system’s line
ending character sequence (i.e. “\\r\\n”).

Once data has matched any expect rule, that data is no longer eligible
to match other expect rules which may already be defined. Data which is
output prior to the definition of an expect rule is not eligible to be
matched against.

The NOEXPECT command removes a previously defined EXPECT command for the
console or a specific multiplexer line.

The SHOW EXPECT command displays all of the pending EXPECT state for the
console or a specific multiplexer line.

If an action command must contain a semicolon, that action command
should be enclosed in quotes so that the entire action command can be
distinguished from the action separator.

### Switches

Switches can be used to influence the behavior of EXPECT rules

#### –p

Expect rules default to be one shot activities. That is, a rule is
automatically removed when a match occurs unless the rule is designated
as a persistent rule by using a –p switch when the rule is defined.

#### –c

If an expect rule is defined with the –c switch, it will cause all
pending expect rules on the current device to be cleared when the rule
matches data in the device output stream.

#### –r

If an expect rule is defined with the –r switch, the string is
interpreted as a regular expression applied to the output data stream.
This regular expression may contain parentheses delimited sub-groups.

The syntax of the regular expressions available are those supported by
the Perl Compatible Regular Expression package (aka PCRE). As the name
implies, the syntax is generally the same as Perl regular expressions.
See <http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html> for more details.

If the PCRE package isn’t available in the environment when a simulator
is built, the local system’s regular expression package (if available)
is used and the regular expression syntax is limited to what may be
provided there.

#### –i

If a regular expression expect rule is defined with the –i switch,
character matching for that expression will be case independent. The –i
switch is only valid for regular expression expect rules (-r).

#### Escaping String Data

The following character escapes are explicitly supported when expect
rules are defined NOT using regular expression match patterns:

> \\r Expect the ASCII Carriage Return character (Decimal value 13)
> 
> \\n Expect the ASCII Linefeed character (Decimal value 10)
> 
> \\f Expect the ASCII Formfeed character (Decimal value 12)
> 
> \\t Expect the ASCII Horizontal Tab character (Decimal value 9)
> 
> \\v Expect the ASCII Vertical Tab character (Decimal value 11)
> 
> \\b Expect the ASCII Backspace character (Decimal value 8)
> 
> \\\\ Expect the ASCII Backslash character (Decimal value 92)
> 
> \\' Expect the ASCII Single Quote character (Decimal value 39)
> 
> \\" Expect the ASCII Double Quote character (Decimal value 34)
> 
> \\? Expect the ASCII Question Mark character (Decimal value 63)
> 
> \\e Expect the ASCII Escape character (Decimal value 27)

as well as octal character values of the form:

> \\n{n{n}} where each n is an octal digit (0-7)

and hext character values of the form:

> \\xh{h} where each h is a hex digit (0-9A-Fa-f)

### Determining which output matched

When an expect rule matches data in the output stream, the rule which
matched is recorded in the environment variable
\_EXPECT\_MATCH\_PATTERN. If the expect rule was a regular expression
rule, then the environment variable \_EXPECT\_MATCH\_GROUP\_0 is set to
the whole string which matched and if the match pattern had any
parentheses delimited sub-groups, the environment variables
\_EXPECT\_MATCH\_GROUP\_1 thru \_EXPECT\_MATCH\_GROUP\_n are set to the
values within the string which matched the respective sub-groups.

## Injecting Input Data

The SEND command provides a way to insert input data in to the console
device of a simulated system as if it were entered by a user:

SEND {AFTER=n,} {DELAY=n,}”\<string\>”

NOSEND

SHOW SEND

The string argument must be delimited by quote characters. Quotes may be
either single or double but the opening and closing quote characters
must match. Data in the string may contain escaped character strings.

The SEND command can also insert input into any serial device on a
simulated system as if it was entered by a user.

SEND \<dev\>:line {AFTER=n,}{DELAY=n,}”\<string\>”

NOSEND \<dev\>:line

SHOW SEND \<dev\>:line

The NOSEND command removes any undelivered input data which may be
pending on the CONSOLE or a specific multiplexer line.

The SHOW SEND command displays any pending SEND activity for the CONSOLE
or a specific multiplexoer line.

### Delay

Specifies a positive integer representing a minimal instruction delay
between characters being sent. The value specified in a delay argument
persists across SEND commands to the same device (console or serial
device). The delay parameter can be set by itself with:

SEND {\<dev\>:line} {DELAY=n}

The default value of the delay parameter is 1000.

### After

Specifies a positive integer representing a minimul number of
instructions which must execute before the first character in the string
is sent. The value specified as the after parameter persists across SEND
commands to the same device (console or serial device). The after
parameter value can be set by itself with:

SEND {\<dev\>:line} {AFTER=n}

If the after parameter isn’t explicitly set, it defaults to the value of
the delay parameter.

### Escaping String Data

The following character escapes are explicitly supported:

> \\r Sends the ASCII Carriage Return character (Decimal value 13)
> 
> \\n Sends the ASCII Linefeed character (Decimal value 10)
> 
> \\f Sends the ASCII Formfeed character (Decimal value 12)
> 
> \\t Sends the ASCII Horizontal Tab character (Decimal value 9)
> 
> \\v Sends the ASCII Vertical Tab character (Decimal value 11)
> 
> \\b Sends the ASCII Backspace character (Decimal value 8)
> 
> \\\\ Sends the ASCII Backslash character (Decimal value 92)
> 
> \\' Sends the ASCII Single Quote character (Decimal value 39)
> 
> \\" Sends the ASCII Double Quote character (Decimal value 34)
> 
> \\? Sends the ASCII Question Mark character (Decimal value 63)
> 
> \\e Sends the ASCII Escape character (Decimal value 27)

as well as octal character values of the form:

\\n{n{n}} where each n is an octal digit (0-7)

and hext character values of the form:

\\xh{h} where each h is a hex digit (0-9A-Fa-f)

## Setting Device Parameters

The SET command (abbreviated SE) changes the status of one or more
device parameters:

SET \<device\> \<parameter\>{=\<value},{\<parameter\>{=\<value\>},...}

or one or more unit parameters:

SET \<unit\> \<parameter\>{=\<value\>},{\<parameter\>{=\<value\>},...}

Most parameters are simulator and device specific. Disk drives, for
example, can usually be set WRITEENABLED or write LOCKED; if a device
supports multiple drive types, the SET command can be used to specify
the drive type.

All devices recognize the following parameters:

OCT sets the data radix = 8

DEC sets the data radix = 10

HEX sets the data radix = 16

## Displaying Parameters and Status

The SHOW command (abbreviated SH) displays the status of one or more
device parameters:

SHOW {\<modifiers} \<device\> \<parameter\>{=\<value\>},

> {\<parameter\>{=\<value\>},...}

or one or more unit parameters:

SHOW {\<modifiers} \<unit\> \<parameter\>{=\<value\>},

{\<parameter\>{=\<value\>},...}

There are two kinds of modifiers: switches and output file. Switches
have been described previously. The output file modifier redirects
command output to a file instead of the console. An output file modifier
consists of @ followed by a valid file name.

All devices implement parameters RADIX (the display radix), MODIFIERS
(list of valid modifiers), and NAMES (logical name). Other device and
unit parameters are implementation-specific.

SHOW is also used to display global simulation state:

SHOW CONFIGURATION shows the simulator configuration and

> the status of all devices and units

SHOW DEVICES shows the simulator configuration

SHOW FEATURES shows the simulator configuration with

> descriptions

SHOW MODIFIERS shows all available modifiers

SHOW NAMES show all logical names

> SHOW QUEUE shows the simulator event queue

SHOW TIME shows the elapsed time since the last RUN

SHOW VERSION show the simulator version and options

SHOW \<device\> shows the status of the named device

SHOW \<unit\> shows the status of the named unit

SHOW THROTTLE shows the current throttling mode

SHOW SHOW shows the show options for all devices

SHOW ETHERNET shows the status/availability of host

> Ethernet devices

SHOW SERIAL shows the status of host serial ports

SHOW MULTIPLEXER shows the status of all multiplexer devices

> which have been attached

SHOW DEFAULT shows the current working directory

SHOW DEBUG shows the debug state of the simulator

SHOW LOG shows the logging state of the simulator

The SHOW DEVICES, SHOW CONFIGURATION, SHOW FEATURES will normally
display all devices which exist in the simulator. These commands can
optionally only display the enabled devices when the –E switch is on the
command line (i.e. SHOW –E DEVICES).

SHOW QUEUE and SHOW TIME display time in simulator-specific units;
typically, one time unit represents one instruction execution.

## Altering the Simulated Configuration

In most simulators, the SET \<device\> DISABLED command removes the
specified device from the configuration. A DISABLED device is invisible
to running programs. The device can still be RESET, but it cannot be
ATTAChed, DETACHed, or BOOTed. SET \<device\> ENABLED restores a
disabled device to a configuration.

Most multi-unit devices allow units to be enabled or disabled:

SET \<unit\> ENABLED

SET \<unit\> DISABLED

When a unit is disabled, it will not be displayed by SHOW DEVICE.

The standard device names can be supplemented with logical names.
Logical names must be unique within a simulator (that is, they cannot be
the same as an existing device name). To assign a logical name to a
device:

ASSIGN \<device\> \<log-name\> assign log-name to device

To remove a logical name:

DEASSIGN \<device\> remove logical name

To show the current logical name assignment:

SHOW \<device\> NAMES show logical name, if any

To show all logical names:

SHOW NAMES

## Console Options

Console options are controlled by the SET CONSOLE command.

The console terminal normally runs in the controlling window.
Optionally, the console terminal can be connected to a Telnet port. This
allows systems to emulate a VT100 using the built-in terminal emulation
of the Telnet client.

SET CONSOLE TELNET=\<port\> connect console terminal to Telnet session

> on port

SET CONSOLE NOTELNET disable console Telnet

Connections to the specified port, by default, will be unrestricted.
Connections from particular IPv4 or IPv6 addresses can be restricted or
allowed based on rules you can add to the "port" specifier on the attach
command. You can add as many rules as you need to the attach command
specified with ";ACCEPT=rule-detail" or ";REJECT=rule-detail" where
rule-detail can be an IP address, hostname or network block in CIDR
form. Rules are interpreted in order and if, while processing the list,
the end is reached the connection will be rejected.

Normally a console terminal configured to listen to on a telnet port
requires that a telnet connection be active for the simulator to run. A
telnet console can have its contents written to a buffer and which will
allow the simulator to run without an active telnet connection. When a
telnet connection is established, the buffer contents is presented to
the telnet session and execution continues as if the connection had been
there all along. Console buffering can be enabled by the following
command:

SET CONSOLE TELNET=BUFFERED{=bufsiz}

enable console buffering and optionally

> set the buffer size to ‘bufsiz’. The default buffer size is 32768.

SET CONSOLE TELNET=NOBUFFER disable console buffering

Output to the console telnet session can be logged simultaneously to a
file:

SET CONSOLE TELNET=LOG=\<filename\>

log console port output to file

SET CONSOLE TELNET=NOLOG

disable logging

The console provides a limited key remapping capability:

SET CONSOLE WRU=\<value\> interpret ASCII code value as WRU

SET CONSOLE BRK=\<value\> interpret ASCII code value as BREAK

> (0 disables)

SET CONSOLE DEL=\<value\> interpret ASCII code value as DELETE

SET CONSOLE PCHAR=\<value\> bit mask of printable characters in range

> \[31,0\]

A simulator console can be connected to a serial port on the host
system.

SET CONSOLE SERIAL=ser0 connect console to serial port ser0

SET CONSOLE SERIAL=COM1 connect console to serial port COM1

SET CONSOLE SERIAL=/dev/ttyS0 connect console to serial port /dev/ttyS0

The available Serial ports on the host system can be displayed with the
command:

SHOW SERIAL display available serial ports on host

Serial port speed, character size, parity and stop bits can be indicated
on the by appending the speed, character size, parity and stop bits to
the serial port name:

SET CONSOLE SERIAL=ser0;2400-8N1

This will connect at 2400 with 8 bit characters, no parity and 1 stop
bit. The default serial speed, character size, parity and stop bits is
9600-8N1.

Values are hexadecimal on hex CPU's, octal on all others.

The SHOW CONSOLE command displays the current state of console options:

SHOW CONSOLE show all console options

SHOW CONSOLE TELNET show console Telnet state

SHOW CONSOLE WRU show value assigned to WRU

SHOW CONSOLE BRK show value assigned to BREAK

SHOW CONSOLE DEL show value assigned to DELETE

SHOW CONSOLE PCHAR show value assigned to PCHAR

Both SET CONSOLE and SHOW CONSOLE accept multiple parameters, separated
by commas, e.g.,

SET CONSOLE WRU=5,DEL=177 set code values for WRU and DEL

## Remote Console

During simulator execution, it may occasionally be useful to enter
commands to query or adjust some internal details of the simulator’s
configuration or operation. These activities could be achieved directly
through the initiating session which started the simulator. However, a
simulator may be running in the context of a background process and not
actually have an interactive interface to the initiating process, or it
may be inconvenient to access the initiating process. To support
circumstances like this, a Remote Console facility can be enabled in the
simulator. The remote console capability is configured with the
following commands:

SET REMOTE TELNET=\<port\> enable remote console to connects via Telnet

> to port

SET REMOTE BUFFERSIZE=bufsize specify remote console command output
buffer

> size

SET REMOTE NOTELNET disable remote console Telnet

SET REMOTE CONNECTIONS=n specify the number of concurrent remote

> console sessions available

SET REMOTE TIMEOUT=secs specify the remote console idle command

> timeout

Connections to the specified port, by default, will be unrestricted.
Connections from particular IPv4 or IPv6 addresses can be restricted or
allowed based on rules you can add to the "port" specifier on the attach
command. You can add as many rules as you need to the attach command
specified with ";ACCEPT=rule-detail" or ";REJECT=rule-detail" where
rule-detail can be an IP address, hostname or network block in CIDR
form. Rules are interpreted in order and if, while processing the list,
the end is reached the connection will be rejected.

The remote console configuration details can be viewed with the command:

SHOW REMOTE display remote console configuration

The remote console facility has two modes of command input and
execution:

Single Command Mode: In single command mode you enter one command at a
time and aren't concerned about what the simulated system is doing while
you enter that command. The command is executed once you've hit return.

Multiple Command Mode: In multiple command mode you initiate your
activities by entering the WRU character (usually ^E). This will suspend
the current simulator execution. You then enter commands as needed and
when you are done you enter a CONTINUE command. While entering Multiple
Command commands, if you fail to enter a complete command before the
timeout (specified by "SET REMOTE TIMEOUT=seconds"), a CONTINUE command
is automatically processed and simulation proceeds.

A subset of normal simh commands are available for use in remote console
sessions.

The Single Command Mode commands are: ATTACH, DETACH, PWD, SHOW, DIR,
LS, ECHO, HELP

The Multiple Command Mode commands are: EXAMINE, IEXAMINE, DEPOSIT,
EVALUATE, ATTACH, DETACH, ASSIGN, DEASSIGN, STEP, CONTINUE, PWD, SAVE,
SET, SHOW, DIR, LS, ECHO, HELP

A remote console session will close when a EOF character is entered
(i.e. ^D or ^Z).

### Master Mode

Remote Console Master mode allows full control of simulator operation to
performed over a remote TCP session. This mode is potentially useful for
applications like a simulated CPU front panel interface or remote
debugging with a GDB “Serial Stub”.

Master mode is entered from a simulator command file with the following
command:

SET REMOTE MASTER enter master mode

Operation in Remote Console Master mode requires that the simulator’s
console port be serviced via a telnet connect with a “SET CONSOLE
TELNET=port” command. Both a telnet connection to the console port AND
to the Remote Console port is required be a simulator will enter Master
Mode.

A Master Mode session can return control to the initiating simulator
command with:

SET REMOTE NOMASTER leave master mode

The Remote Console Master Mode commands are: EXAMINE, IEXAMINE, DEPOSIT,
EVALUATE, ATTACH, DETACH, ASSIGN, DEASSIGN, STEP, CONTINUE, PWD, SAVE,
CD, SET, SHOW, DIR, LS, ECHO, HELP, RUN, GO, BOOT, BREAK, NOBREAK, EXIT

## Executing Command Files

The simulator can execute command files with the DO command:

DO \<filename\> {arguments...} execute commands in file

The DO command allows command files to contain substitutable arguments.
The string %n, where n is between 1 and 9, is replaced with argument n
from the DO command line. The string %0 is replaced with \<filename\>.
The sequences \\% and \\\\ are replaced with the literal characters %
and \\, respectively. Arguments with spaces can be enclosed in matching
single or double quotation marks.

If the switch -v is specified, the commands in the file are echoed
before they are executed.

If the switch -e is specified, command processing (including nested
command invocations) will be aborted if a command error is encountered.
(Simulation stop never abort processing; use ASSERT to catch unexpected
stops.) Without the switch, all errors except ASSERT failures will be
ignored, and command processing will continue.

DO commands may be nested up to ten invocations deep.

Several commands are particularly useful within command files. While
they may be executed interactively, they have only limited functionality
when so used.

### Default Command File executed on Simulator Startup

When a simulator starts execution, the following sequence of simh
command files are executed if they are found:

1\_ If a file named **simh.ini** is located in your HOME directory, it
is executed.

2\. If the simh.ini file in your HOME directory isn’t found, a file
named **simh.ini** in your current working directory is executed if it
exists.

3\. If the simulator is invoked with any arguments, then the arguments
are presumed to be a command file and possible arguments to that command
file which is executed.

4\. If the simulator is invoked without any arguments, then a command
file with the same name as the simulator binary with **.ini** appended
that is located in the current working directory is executed.

Note, that up to 2 separate command files may be executed on simulator
startup. The simh.ini file allows the user to define local user
preferences that align with their personal goals for simulator execution
across all simulators that may be used on their system.

### Change Command Execution Flow

Commands in a command file execute in sequence until either an error
trap occurs (when a command completes with an error status), or when an
explicit request is made to start command execution elsewhere with the
GOTO command:

GOTO \<label\>

Labels are lines in a command file which the first non whitespace
character is a ":". The target of a GOTO is the first matching label in
the current do command file which is encountered. Since labels don't do
anything else besides being the targets of goto's, they could also be
used to provide comments in do command files.

### Subroutine Calls

Control can be transferred to a labeled subroutine with:

CALL \<label\>

EXIT

:label

ECHO subroutine called

RETURN

### Pausing Command Execution

A simulator command file may wait for a specific period of time with:

SLEEP NUMBER\[SUFFIX\]...

Pause for NUMBER seconds. SUFFIX may be 's' for seconds (the default),
'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days. NUMBER may be an
arbitrary floating point number. Given two or more arguments, pause for
the amount of time specified by the sum of their values. Note: A SLEEP
command is interruptible with SIGINT (^C).

### Displaying Arbitrary Text

The ECHO and ECHOF commands are useful ways of annotating command files.

#### ECHO command

ECHO prints out its argument on the console (and log) followed by a
newline.

ECHO \<string\> output string to console

If there is no argument, ECHO prints a blank line on the console. This
may be used to provide spacing in the console display or log.

#### ECHOF command

ECHOF prints out its argument on the console (and log) followed by a
newline.

ECHOF {-n} “string”|\<string\> output to console

ECHOF {-n} dev:line “string”|\<string\> output to specified line

If there is no argument, ECHOF prints a blank line. The –n switch
suppresses the output of a newline character. If the string to be output
is surrounded by quotes, the string within the quotes is interpreted as
described in 4.10.3 prior to being output (without the surrounding
quotes).

A command alias can be used to replace the ECHO command with the ECHOF
command as described in 4.16.9

### Testing Simulator State

The ASSERT command tests a simulator state condition expression and
halts command file execution if the condition is false:

ASSERT \<condition-expression\>

If the result of the condition is false, an "Assertion failed" message
is printed, and any running command file is aborted. Otherwise, the
command has no effect.

The IF command tests a simulator state condition expression and executes
one or more commands if the condition is true:

IF \<condition-expression\> \<action\>{; \<action\>…}

{ELSE \<action\>{; \<action\>…}}

If the result of the condition is true, the action command(s) are
executed. Otherwise, the command has no effect. An optional ELSE command
immediately following an IF command will have its command arguments
executed if the IF condition wasn’t satisfied.

If an action command must contain a semicolon, that action command
should be enclosed in quotes so that the entire action command can be
distinguished from the action separator.

#### Condition Expressions

##### Internal Simulator Variables Expressions

> {NOT} {\<dev\>}
> \<reg\>{\<logical-op\>\<value\>}\<conditional-op\>\<value\>

If \<dev\> is not specified, CPU is assumed. \<reg\> is a register
(scalar or subscripted) belonging to the indicated device. The
\<conditional-op\> and optional \<logical-op\> are the same as those
used for "search specifiers" by the EXAMINE and DEPOSIT commands (see
above). The \<value\>s are expressed in the radix specified for \<reg\>,
not in the radix for the device.

If the \<logical-op\> and \<value\> are specified, the target register
value is first altered as indicated. The result is then compared to the
\<value\> via the \<conditional-op\>. If the NOT unary operator precedes
the expression, the results value is inverted.

##### C Style Expressions

Comparisons can optionally be done with complete C style computational
expressions which leverage the C operations in the below table and can
optionally reference any combination of values that are constants or
contained in environment variables or simulator registers. C style
expression evaluation is initiated by enclosing the expression in
parenthesis.

##### 

##### String Comparison Expressions

String Values can be compared with:

> {-i} {NOT} “\<string1\>”|EnvVarName1 \<compare-op\>
> “\<string2\>”|EnvVarName2

The –i switch, if present, causes comparisons to be case insensitive.
The -w switch, if present, causes comparisons to allow arbitrary runs of
whitespace to be equivalent to a single space. The -i and -w switches
may be combined. \<string1\> and \<string2\> are quoted string values
which may have environment variables substituted as desired. Either
string may be an environment variable name whose expanded value will be
used in place of the explicitly quoted string. \<compare-op\> may be one
of:

> \== - equal
> 
> EQU - equal
> 
> \!= - not equal
> 
> NEQ - not equal
> 
> \< - less than
> 
> LSS - less than
> 
> \<= - less than or equal
> 
> LEQ - less than or equal
> 
> \> - greater than
> 
> GTR - greater than
> 
> \>= - greater than or equal
> 
> GEQ - greater than or equal

Comparisons are generic. This means that if both string1 and string2 are
comprised of all numeric digits, then the strings are converted to
numbers and a numeric comparison is performed. For example: “+1” EQU “1”
will be true.

##### File Existence Test

File existence can be determined with:

{NOT} EXIST "\<filespec\>"

{NOT} EXIST \<filespec\>

Specifies a true (false {NOT}) condition if the file exists.

##### File Comparison Test

Files can have their contents compared with:

\-F{W} {NOT} "\<filespec1\>" == "\<filespec2\>"

Specifies a true (false {NOT}) condition if the indicated files have the
same contents. If the -W switch is present, allows arbitrary runs of
whitespace to be considered a single space during file content
comparison.

#### Example Test of Simulator State

A command file might be used to bootstrap an operating system that halts
after the initial load from disk. The ASSERT command is then used to
confirm that the load completed successfully by examining the CPU's "A"
register for the expected value:

; OS bootstrap command file

;

ATTACH DS0 os.disk

BOOT DS

; A register contains error code; 0 = good boot

ASSERT A=0

ATTACH MT0 sys.tape

ATTACH MT1 user.tape

RUN

In the example, if the A register is not 0, the "ASSERT A=0" command
will be echoed, the command file will be aborted with an "Assertion
failed" message. Otherwise, the command file will continue to bring up
the operating system.

Alternative, the IF command could be used to solve the same problem:

; OS bootstrap command file

;

ATTACH DS0 os.disk

BOOT DS

; A register contains error code; 0 = good boot

IF NOT A=0 ECHO Assertion Failed; EXIT AFAIL

ATTACH MT0 sys.tape

ATTACH MT1 user.tape

RUN

Alternative, the IF command could have an arbitrarily complex C
expression syntax to solve the same problem:

; OS bootstrap command file

;

ATTACH DS0 os.disk

BOOT DS

; A register contains error code; 0 = good boot

IF NOT (((A\*256)\>\>7)==0) ECHO Assertion Failed; EXIT AFAIL

ATTACH MT0 sys.tape

ATTACH MT1 user.tape

RUN

### Trapping on command completion conditions

Error traps can be taken when any command returns a non success status.
Actions to be performed for particular status returns are specified with
the ON command.

#### Enabling Error Traps

Error trapping is enabled with:

set on enable error traps

Error trapping is initially disabled.

#### Disabling Error Traps

Error trapping is disabled with:

set noon disable error traps

#### ON Command

To set the action(s) to take when a specific error status is returned by
a command in the currently running do command file:

on \<statusvalue\> commandtoprocess{; additionalcommandtoprocess}

To clear the action(s) taken take when a specific error status is
returned:

on \<statusvalue\>

To set the default action(s) to take when any otherwise unspecified
error status is returned by a command in the currently running do
command file:

on error commandtoprocess{; additionalcommandtoprocess}

To clear the default action(s) taken when any otherwise unspecified
error status is returned:

on error

##### Parameters

Error traps can be taken for any command which returns a status other
than SCPE\_STEP, SCPE\_OK, and SCPE\_EXIT.

ON Traps can specify any of these status values:

NXM, UNATT, IOERR, CSUM, FMT, NOATT, OPENERR, MEM, ARG,

STEP, UNK, RO, INCOMP, STOP, TTIERR, TTOERR, EOF, REL,

NOPARAM, ALATT, TIMER, SIGERR, TTYERR, SUB, NOFNC, UDIS,

NORO, INVSW, MISVAL, 2FARG, 2MARG, NXDEV, NXUN, NXREG,

NXPAR, NEST, IERR, MTRLNT, LOST, TTMO, STALL, AFAIL,

NOTATT, AMBREG

These values can be indicated by name or by their internal numeric value
(not recommended).

CONTROL-C Trapping

A special ON trap is available to describe action(s) to be taken when
CONTROL\_C (aka SIGINT) occurs during the execution of simh commands
and/or command procedures.

on CONTROL\_C \<action\> perform action(s) after CTRL+C

on CONTROL\_C restore default CTRL+C action

The default ON CONTROL\_C handler will exit nested DO command procedures
and return to the sim\> prompt.

Note 1: When a simulator is executing instructions entering CTRL+Cwill
cause the CNTL+C character to be delivered to the simulator as input.
The simulator instruction execution can be stopped by entering

the WRU character (usually CTRL+E). Once instruction execution has
stopped, CTRL+C can be entered and potentially acted on by the ON
CONTROL\_C trap handler.

Note 2: The ON CONTROL\_C trapping is not affected by the SET ON and SET
NOON commands.

### Command arguments

Token "%0" expands to the command file name.

Token %n (n being a single digit) expands to the n'th argument

Token %\* expands to the whole set of arguments (%1 ... %9)

The input sequence "%%" represents a literal "%". All other character
combinations are rendered literally.

Omitted parameters result in null-string substitutions.

Tokens preceeded and followed by % characters are expanded as
environment variables, and if an environment variable isn't found then
it can be one of the available Build-In variables.

#### DO command argument manipulation

The SHIFT command will shift the %1 thru %9 arguments to the left one
position.

#### Built-In Variables

#### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be explicitly defined and subsequently
available for command substitution:

SET ENV variablename=value

##### Gathering User Input Into an Environment Variable

Input from a user can be obtained by:

SET ENV -p "Prompt String" name=default

The -p switch indicates that the user should be prompted with the
indicated prompt string and the input provided will be saved in the
environment variable 'name'. If no input is provided, the value
specified as 'default' will be used.

##### Arithmetic Expressions

Arithmetic Computations into a Variable

SET ENVIRONMENT -A name=expression

Expression can contain any of these C language operators:

|      |                       |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| (    | Open Parenthesis      |
| )    | Close Parenthesis     |
| \-   | Subtraction           |
| \+   | Addition              |
| \*   | Multiplication        |
| /    | Division              |
| %    | Modulus               |
| &&   | Logical AND           |
| ||   | Logical OR            |
| &    | Bitwise AND           |
| |    | Bitwise Inclusive OR  |
| ^    | Bitwise Exclusive OR  |
| \>\> | Bitwise Right Shift   |
| \<\< | Bitwise Left Shift    |
| \==  | Equality              |
| \!=  | Inequality            |
| \<=  | Less than or Equal    |
| \<   | Less than             |
| \>=  | Greater than or Equal |
| \>   | Greater than          |
| \!   | Logical Negation      |
| \~   | Bitwise Compliment    |

Operator precedence is consistent with C language precedence.

Expression can contain arbitrary combinations of constant

values, simulator registers and environment variables. For example:

sim\> SET ENV -A A=7+2

sim\> ECHO A=%A%

A=9

sim\> SET ENV -A A=A-1

sim\> ECHO A=%A%

A=8

### Command Aliases

Commands can be aliases with environment variables. For example:

sim\> set env echo=echof

sim\> echo “Hello there”

Hello there

## Executing System Commands

The simulator can execute operating system commands with the \! (spawn)
command:

\! \<host operating system command\>

If no operating system command is provided, the simulator attempts to
launch the host operating system's command shell.

## Getting Help

The HELP command prints out information about a command or about all
commands:

HELP print all HELP messages

HELP \<command\> print HELP for command

HELP \<device\> print HELP for device

HELP \<device\> REGISTERS print HELP for device register variables

HELP \<device\> ATTACH print HELP for device specific attach

HELP \<device\> SET print HELP for device specific SET commands

HELP \<device\> SHOW print HELP for device specific SHOW commands

##  Recording Simulator activities

The interactions performed with the simulator (at the “sim\>” prompt)
and the output that those interactions produce can be recorded to a log
file/

SET LOG \<filename\> direct log output to file

SET LOG STDERR direct log output to stderr

SET LOG DEBUG direct log output to debug file

SET NOLOG disable output logging

Output produced by the simulated console device will also be written to
the configured log file if the console is not provided via a telnet
session (i.e. SET CONSOLE TELNET=port). The output produced by a console
telnet session can also be written to the simulator log file with:

SET CONSOLE TELNET=LOG=LOG direct log output to log file

### Switches

By default, log output is written at the end of the specified log file.
A new log file can be created if the –N switch is used on the command
line.

## Controlling Debugging

Some simulated devices may provide debug printouts to help in diagnosing
complicated problems. Debug output may be sent to a variety of places,
or disabled entirely:

SET DEBUG STDOUT direct debug output to stdout

SET DEBUG STDERR direct debug output to stderr

SET DEBUG LOG direct debug output to log file

SET DEBUG \<filename\> direct debug output to file

SET NODEBUG disable debug output

### *Switches*

Debug message output contains a timestamp which indicates the number of
simulated instructions which have been executed prior to the debug
event.

Debug message output can be enhanced to contain additional, potentially
useful information.

#### –f

The -F switch suppresses the internal logic which coalesces successive
identical debug output lines into one followed by an indicator of how
many times the same line was output. This mode is most appropriate when
output is being displayed in real time to STDOUT or STDERR.

#### –t

The -T switch causes debug output to contain a time of day displayed as
hh:mm:ss.msec.

#### \-a

The -A switch causes debug output to contain a time of day displayed as
seconds.msec.

#### \-r

The -R switch causes the time of day displayed due to the -T or –A
switches to be relative to the start time of debugging. If neither -T or
-A is explicitly specified, -T is implied.

#### –p

The -P switch adds the output of the PC (Program Counter) to each debug
message.

#### \-n

The -N switch causes a new/empty file to be written to. The default is
to append to an existing debug log file.

#### \-d

The -D switch causes data blob output to also display the data as
RADIX-50 characters.

#### \-e

The -E switch causes data blob output to also display the data as EBCDIC
characters.

### *Device Debug options*

If debug output is enabled, individual devices can be controlled with
the SET command. If a device has only a single debug flag:

SET \<device\> DEBUG enable device debug output

SET \<device\> NODEBUG disable device debug output

If the device has individual, named debug flags:

SET \<device\> DEBUG enable all debug flags

SET \<device\> DEBUG=n1;n2;... enable debug flags n1, n2, ...

SET \<device\> NODEBUG=n1;n2;... disable debug flags n1, n2, ...

SET \<device\> NODEBUG disable all debug flags

If debug output is directed to stdout, it will be intermixed with normal
simulator output.

### *Displaying Debug settings*

The current debug settings for output destination, options and device
specific debug settings can be displayed with:

> SHOW DEBUG display the current debug settings

## Exiting the Simulator

EXIT (synonyms QUIT and BYE) returns control to the operating system. An
optional numeric exit status may be provided on the EXIT command line
that an operating system script may act on.

> EXIT {status} return to the operating system

## Manipulating Files within the Simulator

Tools to manipulate file containers and to transfer files/data into or
out of a simulated environment are provided.

In general, these are tools natively found on the host operating system.
They are explicitly support directly from SCP to allow for platform
neutral scripts that either test or build running environments for simh
users.

### Manipulating File Archives

The **tar** command is provided to pack unpack archives as needed.

> tar -czf xyz.tar.gz \*.dsk archive disk image files
> 
> tar -xf xyz.tar extract files from an archive

### Transferring data from the web

The **curl** command is provided to access data across the web.

> curl -L <https://github.com/simh/simh/archive/master.zip> --output
> master.zip

# Appendix 1: File Representations

All file representations are little-endian. On big-endian hosts, the
simulator automatically performs any required byte swapping.

## A.1 Hard Disks

Hard disks are represented as unstructured binary files of 16b data
items for the 12b and 16b simulators, of 32b data items for the 18b,
24b, and 32b simulators, and 64b for the 36b simulators. Device
simulations which use the sim\_disk library can also have hard disks
which are Virtual Hard Disks (as described by the Microsoft Open
Specification) and for Windows and Linux hosts can be raw host disks
and/or CDROM devices. Disk containers may have 512 bytes of metadata
beyond the emulated capacity of the drive. If present, the metadata
describes details about the actual drive being emulated and potential
additional parameters which may be useful in simulation.

## A.2 Floppy Disks

Floppy disks are represented as unstructured binary files of 8b data
items. They are nearly identical to the floppy disk images for Doug
Jones' PDP-8 simulator but lack the initial 256 byte header. A utility
for converting between the two formats is easily written.

## A.3 Magnetic Tapes

SIMH format magnetic tapes are represented as unstructured binary files
of 8b data items. Each record starts with a 32b record header, in little
endian format. If the record header is not a special header, it is
followed by n 8b bytes of data, followed by a repeat of the 32b record
header. A 1 in the high order bit of the record header indicates an
error in the record. If the byte count is odd, the record is padded to
even length; the pad byte is undefined.

Special record headers occur only once and have no data. The currently
defined special headers are:

0x00000000 file mark

0xFFFFFFFF end of medium

0xFFFFFFFE erase gap

Magnetic tapes are endian independent and consistent across simulator
families. A magnetic tape produced by the Nova simulator will appear to
have its 16b words byte swapped if read by the PDP-11 simulator.

SIMH can read and write E11-format magnetic tape images. E11 format
differs from SIMH format only for odd-length records; the data portion
of E11 records is not padded with an extra byte.

SIMH can read TPC-format magnetic tape images. TPC format uses a 16b
record header, with 0x0000 denoting file mark. The record header is not
repeated at the end of the record. Odd-length records are padded with an
extra byte. Some TPC formatted tapes have an end of medium indicated as
a record length of 0xffff with no data following the record length.

SIMH can read Pierce-format seven-track magnetic tape images. Pierce
format uses only 6 data bits, and one parity bit, in each byte. The high
order bit indicates start of record. End of file is indicated by a
record of one (occasionally two) bytes consisting of code 017 (octal).

SIMH can read and write AWS format tape images. AWS format uses a 3 16b
(little endian) word record header which are a next record size,
previous record size and a flag word. The flag word uses value 0x40 to
flag tape marks, and 0xA0 for data records.

SIMH can directly read from TAR files. TAR files are read directly and
presented through the tape interface as tape records of a fixed size.
The default TAR record size is 10240. A specific record size can be
specified by using the –B switch on the ATTACH command. Since the
specified input file is merely presented as fixed sized records to the
simulated system reading from a tape, other data could also be presented
via this same mechanism. For example, if a system was able to read 80
byte card images from a tape drive, a binary input file could be
attached with a –B 80 and it would be read 80 bytes at a time.

SIMH can present the content of local text and binary files on a pseudo
tape device. This is achieved by using one of ANSI-VMS, ANSI-RT11,
ANSI-RSTS or ANSI-RSX11 tape formats. The attach command for any ANSI
format tape takes a list of file names (which may contain wildcards) and
makes them available to a simulated system via the attached tape device
presented as an ANSI labeled tape with each file having its attributes
presented to the simulated OS. Text files can contain LF or CRLF line
endings and they will be visible to an operating system which can read
an ANSI tape as normal data in the expected form. Binary files are
presented as fixed sized 512 byte records.

## A.4 Line Printers

Line printer output is represented by an ASCII file of lines separated
by the newline character. Overprinting is represented by a line ending
in return rather than newline.

## A.5 DECtapes

DECtapes are structured as fixed length blocks. PDP-1/4/7/9/15 DECtapes
use 578 blocks of 256 32b words. Each 32b word contains 18b (6 lines) of
data. PDP-11 DECtapes use 578 blocks of 256 16b words. Each 16b word
contains 6 lines of data, with 2b omitted. This is compatible with
native PDP-11 DECtape dump facilities, and with John Wilson's PUTR
Program. PDP-8 DECtapes use 1474 blocks of 129 16b words. Each 16b word
contains 12b (4 lines) of data. PDP-8 OS/8 does not use the 129th word
of each block, and OS/8 DECtape dumps contain only 128 words per block.
A utility, DTOS8CVT.C, is provided to convert OS/8 DECtape dumps to
simulator format.

A known issue in DECtape format is that when a block is recorded in one
direction and read in the other, the bits in a word are scrambled (to
the complement obverse). The PDP-11 deals with this problem by
performing an automatic complement obverse on reverse writes and reads.
The other systems leave this problem to software.

The simulator represents this difference as follows. On the PDP-11, all
data is represented in normal form. Data reads and writes are not
direction sensitive; read all and write all are direction sensitive.
Real DECtapes that are read forward will generate images with the
correct representation of the data.

On the other systems, forward write creates data in normal form, while
reverse write creates data in complement obverse form. Forward read (and
read all) performs no transformations, while reverse read (and read all)
changes data to the complement obverse. Real DECtapes that are read
forward

will generate data in normal form for blocks written forward, and
complement obverse data for blocks written in reverse, corresponding to
the simulator format.
