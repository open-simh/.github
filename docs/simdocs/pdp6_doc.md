#  Introduction

Originally the DEC PDP10 computer started as the PDP6. This was a 36 bit
computer that was designed for timesharing, which was introduced in
1964. The original goal of the machine was to allow for processing of
many 6 bit characters at a time. 36 bits were also common in machines
like the IBM 7090, GE 645, and Univac 11xx lines. Several systems
influenced the design of the PDP6, like CTSS, Lisp, support for larger
memory. The PDP6 was canceled by DEC due to production problems. The
engineers designed a smaller replacement, which happened to be a 36 bit
computer that looked very much like the PDP6. This was called the PDP10.
Later renamed to "DECSystem-10". The system supported up to 256K words
of memory.

The first PDP10 was labeled KA10, and added a few instructions to the
PDP6. Both the PDP6 and PDP10 used a base and limit relocation scheme.
The KA10 generally offered two registers, one of user data and the
second for user shared code. These were referred to the Low-Segment and
High-Segment, the High-Segment could be shared with several jobs. The
next version was called KI10 for Integrated. This added support for
paging and double precision floating point instructions. It also added 4
sets of registers to improve context switching time. It could also
support up to 4Mega words of memory. Following the KI10 was the KL10
(for Low-Cost). The KL10 added double precision integer instructions and
instructions to improve COBOL performance. This was the first version
which was microcoded. The KL10 was extended to support user programs
larger then 256k. The final version to make it to market was the KS10
(for Small), this was a bit-slice version of the PDP10 which used UNIBUS
devices which were cheaper then the KL10 devices.

The original operating system for the PDP6/PDP10 was just called
"Monitor". It was designed to fit into 6K words. Around the 3rd release
Swapping was added. The 6'th release saw the addition of virtual memory.
Around the 4'th release it was given the name "TOPS-10". Around this
time BBN was working on a paging system and implemented it on the PDP10.
This was called "Tenex". This was later adopted by DEC and became
"Tops-20".

During the mid 60's a group at MIT, who where not happy with how Multics
was being developed decided to create their own operating system which
they called Incompatible Timesharing System "ITS", was a play on the
original project called Compatible Timesharing System "CTSS". CTSS was
implemented by MIT on their IBM 7090 as an experimental system that
allowed multiple time sharing users to co-exist on the same machine
running batch processing. Hence the term Compatable.

Also during the mid 60's a group at Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (SAIL), started with a version of TOPS-10 and heavily
modified it to become WAITS.

During the 70's Tymshare starting with DEC TOPS-10 system modified it to
support random access files, paging with working sets and spawn-able
processes. This ran on the KI10, KL10 and KS10.

The PDP10 was ultimately replaced by the VAX.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions.

This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU HISTORY commands:

|                    |                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| SET CPU HISTORY    | clear history buffer                 |
| SET CPU HISTORY=0  | disable history                      |
| SET CPU HISTORY=n  | enable history, length = n           |
| SHOW CPU HISTORY   | print CPU history                    |
| SHOW CPU HISTORY=n | print first n entries of CPU history |

Instruction tracing shows the Program counter, the contents of AC
selected, the computed effective address. AR is generally the contents
the memory location referenced by EA. RES is the result of the
instruction. FLAGS shows the flags after the instruction is executed. IR
shows the instruction being executed.

##  Unit record I/O Devices

###  Console Teletype (CTY) (Device 120)

The console station allows for communications with the operating system.

###  Type 340 Graphics display (Device 130)

By default this device is not enabled. When enabled and commands are
sent to it a graphics windows will display.

##  DCS Type 630 Terminal Multiplexer (Device 300)

Terminal multiplexers must be attached in order to work. The ATTACH
command specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

|                              |                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ATTACH \<device\> *\<port\>* | set up listening port |

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used other TCP/IP activities.

Once attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens for
connections on the specified port. It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connections. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET \<device\> DISCONNECT
command,or a DETACH \<device\> command.

|                               |                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| SET \<device\> DISCONNECT=*n* | Disconnect line *n* |

The \<device\> implements the following special SHOW commands

|                             |                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| SHOW \<device\> CONNECTIONS | Displays current connections to the \<device\> |
| SHOW \<device\> STATISTICS  | Displays statistics for active connections     |
| SHOW \<device\> LOG         | Display logging for all lines                  |

Logging can be controlled as follows:

|                                   |                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| SET \<device\> LOG=*n*=*filename* | Log output of line *n* to *filename* |
| SET \<device\> NOLOG              | Disable logging and close log file   |

###  DCT Type 136 Data Control (Device 200/204)

This device acted as a data multiplexer for the Dectape/Magtape and
Disk. Individual devices could be assigned channels on this device.
Devices which use the DCT include a DCT option with takes two octal
digits, the first is the DCT device 0 or 1, the second is the channel 1
to 7.

###  DTC Type 551 Dectape controller (Device 210)

This was the standard Dectape controller for the PDP6. This controller
loads the tape into memory and uses the buffered version. You need to
specify which DCT unit and channel the tape is connected to.

|                |                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SET DTC DCT=uc | Sets the DTC to connect to DCT unit and channel. |

Each individual tape drive support several options:

|                        |                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SET DTC*n* LOCKED      | Sets the mag tape to be read only.               |
| SET DTC*n* WRITEENABLE | Sets the mag tape to be writable.                |
| SET DTC*n* 18b         | Default, tapes are considered to be 18bit tapes. |
| SET DTC*n* 16b         | Tapes are converted from 16 bit to 18bit.        |
| SET DTC*n* 12b         | Tapes are converted from 12 bit to 18bit.        |

###  MTC Type 516 Magtape controller (Device 220)

This was the standard Magtape controller for the PDP6. This device
handled only 7 track tapes. The simulator has the option to
automatically translate 8 track tapes into 7 track tapes. You need to
specify which DCT unit and channel the tape is connected to.

|                |                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SET MTC DCT=uc | Sets the MTC to connect to DCT unit and channel. |

Each individual tape drive support several options:

|                        |                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| SET MTC*n* LOCKED      | Sets this unit to be read only.                          |
| SET MTC*n* WRITEENABLE | Sets this unit to be writable.                           |
| SET MTC*n* 9T          | Sets this unit to simulated 9 track format.              |
| SET MTC*n* 7T          | Sets this unit to read/write 7 track tapes (with parity) |

###  DSK Type 270 Disk controller (Device 270)

The 270 disk could support up to 4 units. The controller had to be
connected to a type 136 Data Controller. You need to specify which DCT
unit and channel the disk is connected to.

|                |                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SET DSK DCT=uc | Sets the DSK to connect to DCT unit and channel. |

Each individual disk drive support several options:

|                        |                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| SET DSK*n* LOCKED      | Sets this unit to be read only. |
| SET DSK*n* WRITEENABLE | Sets this unit to be writable.  |

#  Symbolic Display and Input

The KA10 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are
controlled by the following switches to the EXAMINE and DEPOSIT
commands:

|     |                                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------ |
| \-a | Display/Enter ASCII data.            |
| \-p | Display/Enter packed ASCII data.     |
| \-c | Display/Enter Sixbit Character data. |
| \-m | Display/Enter Symbolic instructions  |
|     | Display/Enter Octal data.            |

Symbolic instructions can be of the formats:

  - Opcode ac,operand

  - Opcode operands

  - I/O Opcode device,address

Operands can be one or more of the following in order:

  - Optional @ for indirection.

  - \+ or – to set sign.

  - Octal number

  - Optional (ac) for indexing.

Breakpoints can be set at real memory address. The PDP10 supports 3
types of breakpoints. Execution, Memory Access and Memory Modify. The
default is execution. Adding -R to the breakpoint command will stop the
simulator on access to that memory location, either via fetch,
indirection or operand access. Adding -w will stop the simulator when
the location is modified.

The simulator can load RIM files, SAV files, EXE files, Waits Octal DMP
files, MIT SBLK files.

When instruction history is enabled, the history trace shows internal
status of various registers at the start of the instruction execution.

| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PC    | Shows the PC of the instruction executed.                             |
| AC    | The contents of the referenced AC.                                    |
| EA    | The final computed Effective address.                                 |
| AR    | Generally the operand that was computed.                              |
| RES   | The AR register after the instruction was complete.                   |
| FLAGS | The values of the FLAGS register before execution of the instruction. |
| IR    | The fetched instruction followed by the disassembled instruction.     |
