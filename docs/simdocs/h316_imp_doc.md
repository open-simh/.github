# Introduction

This memorandum documents the extensions made to the simh Honeywell H316
simulator to allow it to run the ARPANET Interface Message Processor
(aka IMP) and Terminal Interface Processor (TIP) software.

A single IMP or TIP instance isn't very useful, however these extensions allow
multiple simh instances, each running a copy of the IMP or TIP code, to
communicate using virtual modem connections implemented with physical
serial ports on the host computer.

Alternatively, virtual modem
connections may be tunneled over TCP/IP to a remote simh IMP/TIP
instance anywhere in the world.

Moreover, each simh IMP instance can
then be connected via virtual host interface cards to other local PDP-10
or PDP-11 simh instances running ARPANET host software.

# Simulator Files

# Additional Features and Devices

The IMP/TIP adds the following devices to the H316 configuration:

| device name | simulates                                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MI          | modem interface (up to 5)                                                   |
| HI          |  host interface (up to 4)                                                   |
| WDT         |  watchdog timer                                                             |
| RTC         |  real time clock (replaces H316 CLK device)                                 |
| IMP         |  TASK, IMPN and MLC functions (addresses 41<sub>8</sub> and 42<sub>8</sub>) |

## IMP Pseudo Device

The IMP pseudo device implements two sets of miscellaneous I/O
instructions in the original IMP/TIP hardware. This device responds both
to IO address 41<sub>8</sub>, which implements the TASK switching interrupt and
the IMP identification number, and to IO address 42<sub>8</sub>, which implements
the MLC test. The IMP device may be enabled with the standard command

    SET IMP ENABLED

The IMP address, which is returned by the RDIMPN (INA 1041) instruction,
may be set with the command

    SET IMP NUM=n               set IMP station address to n

This value was apparently hardwired into each original IMP/TIP station.
The IMP device also implements the AMIMLC (SKS 0042) instruction, which
skips if the current hardware is a multi-line controller (aka a TIP).
Since TIP emulation is not currently supported, this instruction is
presently hard wired as a NOP (i.e. it never skips).

### Registers

The IMP device implements the following registers:

| name | size | comments               |
|------|------|------------------------|
| MLC  | 1    | always zero (TIP flag) |
| IEN  | 1    | task interrupt enabled |
| IRQ  | 1    | task interrupt pending |

These registers can be viewed with the command

    EXAMINE IMP STATE

### Debugging flags

The IMP device implements these debugging flags:

    SET IMP DEBUG=WARN          print warnings for unusual conditions
    SET IMP DEBUG=IO            trace all IMP device I/O instructions

Remember that you must enable debugging output first before these
settings will be effective; refer to the *SIMH User's Guide*,
"Controlling Debugging," for more information.

## Real Time Clock

The IMP/TIP hardware contained a custom real time clock which was unique
to that implementation, and further, the IMP/TIP did not have the
standard H316 power line clock or real time clock. The IMP/TIP clock is
in some ways similar to the H316 real time clock option, *but it is not
the same*. Normally the CLK device would be disabled when emulating the
IMP, however there is no actual conflict between the CLK and the RTC
devices and both can be enabled simultaneously.

The RTC device supports the following SET commands:

    SET RTC ENABLED             enable RTC emulation
    SET RTC INTERVAL=i          set the RTC tick interval to i microseconds
    SET RTC QUANTUM=q           set the RTC resolution to q ticks

The INTERVAL parameter sets the interval between RTC clock ticks, in
microseconds and the QUANTUM parameter sets how often, as a number of
clock ticks, simh updates the RTC count. To give an example, if INTERVAL
was set to 20 and QUANTUM was 1, simh would attempt to increment the RTC
count by one at a rate of 50,000 times per second. Modern PCs are very
fast and it would probably be possible for simh to do this, but the
amount of overhead would be huge and it would be impractical.

Instead, for example, if INTERVAL was still set to 20 but QUANTUM was
now set to 50, simh would add 50 to the RTC count at a rate of 1000
times per second. This represents much less overhead and yet gives the
same net counting rate as before. However, now the clock count jumps in
increments of 50 rather than 1. Most software wouldn't notice, but it's
always possible this could cause problems.

It's important to note that the QUANTUM does not affect the overall
clock frequency -- as long as the INTERVAL is set to 20 the clock would
count at an effective rate of 50 kHz regardless of the QUANTUM value.

### Registers

The RTC device implements the following registers:

| name  | size | comments                           |
|-------|------|------------------------------------|
| ENA   | 1    | RTC is enabled                     |
| COUNT | 16   | current count                      |
| IEN   | 1    | RTC interrupt enabled              |
| IRQ   | 1    | RTC interrupt pending              |
| TPS   | 1    | effective ticks per second         |
| WAIT  | 24   | simulator time until the next tick |

These registers can be viewed with the command

    EXAMINE RTC STATE

### Debugging flags

The RTC device implements these debugging flags:

    SET RTC DEBUG=WARN          print warnings for unusual conditions
    SET RTC DEBUG=IO            trace all RTC device I/O instructions

Please refer to the *SIMH User's Guide*, "Controlling Debugging," for
more information and remember that you must enable debugging output
first before these settings will be effective.

## Watch Dog Timer

The IMP/TIP hardware also had a custom watch dog timer implementation
which would force a non-maskable interrupt if was ever allowed to
expire. The WDT device in simh implements this feature. The IMP/TIP
watch dog timer also implemented a couple of other unrelated features --
these include the status display panel, which you can see featured
prominently in some IMP photos, and a flag to indicate whether the CPU
was a H316 or DDP-516.

The WDT device supports the following SET commands

    SET WDT ENABLED             enable WDT emulation
    SET WDT DELAY=n             set the WDT delay to n milliseconds

The DELAY parameter sets the WDT timeout, in milliseconds. This is a 16
bit unsigned value, so the maximum WDT delay is just over a minute. Note
that there are no H316 instructions that disable the WDT -- only one to
reset it -- so if *the WDT device is enabled the WDT will run anytime
simulation is active*. If the code fails to reset the WDT in a timely
fashion, the WDT interrupt will occur regardless of the enabled or
disabled state of the interrupt system.

Setting the WDT delay to zero
prevents the WDT from ever generating a timeout. This special feature
allows the WDT device to be enabled, so that code which executes WDT,
status light or AMI512 instructions can be executed and debugged, but
without inadvertently triggering a WDT timeout.

### Registers

The WDT device implements the following registers

| name   | size | comments                           |
|--------|------|------------------------------------|
| COUNT  | 16   | current countdown                  |
| TMO    | 1    | WDT timed out                      |
| LIGHTS | 16   | last "set status lights"           |
| WAIT   | 24   | calcuated time until the next tick |

These registers can be viewed with the command

    EXAMINE WDT STATE

### Debugging flags

The WDT device implements these debugging flags:

    SET WDT DEBUG=WARN          print warnings for unusual conditions
    SET WDT DEBUG=IO            trace all WDT device I/O instructions
    SET WDT DEBUG=LIGHTS        trace IMP status light changes

Remember that you must enable debugging output first before these
settings will be effective; refer to the *SIMH User's Guide*,
"Controlling Debugging," for more information.

## Communications Devices

### Modem Interface

IMPs and TIPs communicated with each other via leased telephone lines
and synchronous modem links. These modem links were point to point --
each IMP/TIP modem communicated with exactly one other modem attached to
exactly one other IMP/TIP. SIMH simulates these modem interfaces and
allows them to be attached to either a real, physical, serial port on
the host computer or to a virtual UDP/IP port. Either can then be
connected to another simh instance running the IMP/TIP software, or even
a real IMP or TIP if someone gets one working again, and a network can
be assembled.

Simh implements five modem interfaces, MI1 thru MI5. Initially MI1 thru
3 are enabled and MI4 and 5 are not, however this can be changed with
the commands:

    SET MIn ENABLED             enable modem line n
    SET MIn DISABLED            disable modem line n

A limitation of the original IMP hardware is that the DMC channels used
by modem lines 4 and 5 conflict with those used by host interfaces 3 and
4. Thus it not possible to enable all modem lines and all host
interfaces at the same time (see 3.2.1.2).

Modem interfaces implement one parameter which may be explicitly set:

    SET MIn BPS=56000

This parameter sets the simulated line speed, in bits per second, for
UDP/IP virtual modem connections.

Modem interfaces also implement an interface (local) and a line (remote)
loopback feature. This cause the modem to receive its own transmitted
messages, and are analogous to features in the IMP modem hardware.
Loopback may be enabled or disabled with these commands

    SET MIn LOOPINTERFACE       enable interface loopback on line n
    SET MIn NOLOOPINTERFACE     disable interface loopback
    SET MIn LOOPLINE            enable line loopback on line n
    SET MIn NOLOOPLINE          disable line loopback

#### Registers

Modem interfaces support the following registers:

| name   | size | comments                                  |
|--------|------|-------------------------------------------|
| RXPOLL | 32   |  receiver polling interval                |
| RXPEND | 1    | receiver waiting for input                |
| RXERR  | 1    |  receiver error flag                      |
| RXIEN  | 1    |  receiver interrupt enable                |
| RXIRQ  | 1    |  receiver interrupt request               |
| RXTOT  | 32   |  count of total messages received         |
| TXDLY  | 32   |  calculated delay before transmitter done |
| TXIEN  | 1    |  transmitter interrupt enable             |
| TXIRQ  | 1    |  transmitter interrupt request            |
| TXTOT  | 32   |  count of total messages transmitted      |
| LINK   | 32   |  link number for h316\_udp module         |
| BPS    | 32   |  simulated line speed for UDP connections |
| ILOOP  | 1    |  interface (local) loopback enabled       |
| LLOOP  | 1    |  line (remote) loopback enabled           |

These registers can be viewed with the command

    EXAMINE MIn STATE

#### Debugging flags

The modem device implements these debugging flags:

    SET MIn DEBUG=WARN          print warnings for unusual conditions
    SET MIn DEBUG=IO            trace all modem interface I/O instructions
    SET MIn DEBUG=UDP           trace all UDP packets and connections
    SET MIn DEBUG=MSG           trace all IMP messages sent or received

Remember that you must enable debugging output first before these
settings will be effective; refer to the *SIMH User's Guide*,
"Controlling Debugging," for more information.

#### UDP/IP Tunnels

A virtual modem may also be tunneled using UDP/IP to another simh
instance. UDP connections are symmetrical -- each virtual modem listens
for incoming packets on a port which you define, and transmit outgoing
packets to another host and port which you also define. It's your
responsibility to define the ports appropriately so that the input of
one modem is logically connected to the output of another modem. *These
connections must be one to one*. Connecting more than one modem output
to the same modem input will not cause any problems for SIMH, but the
IMP software will become hopelessly confused.

The general form of a virtual modem ATTACH command for UDP connections
is like this

    ATTACH MIn llll:w.x.y.z:rrrr

This will listen for incoming packets on port "llll", which should be a
decimal number, and will transmit outgoing packets to port "rrrr" on the
host with IP address "w.x.y.z". The actual port numbers you use are
arbitrary; however some care must be used to avoid conflicts with any
other network applications.

The UDP attach command also has a few alternative forms; for example

    ATTACH MIn 4431:imp.jfcl.com:4432

will listen on port 4431 of the current host, do a DNS lookup to
determine the IP of the host "`imp.jfcl.com`", and then transmit to port
4432 on that host. In another example

    ATTACH MIn 1201::1202

will listen to port 1201 on the current, local, host and transmit to
port 1202 also on the local host. This is useful when both SIMH
instances are running on the same PC. In this case, *you must use
different ports for transmitting and receiving*. If they are the same,
the modem will transmit to itself!

Either end of the UDP connection may be disconnected with the command

    DETACH MIn

#### Physical Serial Tunnels

The command

    ATTACH --p MIn COMnn

is reserved for a possible future option to attach a physical serial
port to a virtual modem. This functionality is not currently
implemented.

## Host Interface

**NOTE:** The current Host Interface implementation is presently only a
skeleton -- just enough code exists to allow the IMP software to run. In this
version, the IMP effectively sees all attached hosts as permanently
powered down. Hopefully the host interface implementation can be
completed at some point, just as soon as there is a suitable host
emulator for it to talk to.


The IMP used the host interface to connect the H316 to an Arpanet host
mainframe. This could be a PDP-10, an SDS Sigma 7, a CDC 6600, an IBM
360, or any one of many other machines. Each IMP could support up to
four host interface cards; in simh these are the devices HI1 thru HI4.
Initially HI1 and 2 are enabled and HI3 and 4 are not, however this can
be changed with the commands:

    SET HIn ENABLED             enable host interface n
    SET HIn DISABLED            disable host interface n

### Registers

Host interfaces support the following registers:

| name  | size | comments                            |
|-------|------|-------------------------------------|
| POLL  | 32   | host polling interval               |
| RXIEN | 1    | receiver interrupt enable           |
| RXIRQ | 1    | receiver interrupt request          |
| RXTOT | 32   | count of total messages received    |
| TXIEN | 1    | transmitter interrupt enable        |
| TXIRQ | 1    | transmitter interrupt request       |
| TXTOT | 32   | count of total messages transmitted |
| READY | 1    | host ready                          |
| FULL  | 1    | host buffer full                    |
| ERROR | 1    | host error                          |
| LLOOP | 1    | local loopback enabled              |

These registers can be viewed with the command

    EXAMINE HIn STATE

The modem device implements these debugging flags:

    SET HIn DEBUG=IO            trace all host interface I/O instructions

Remember that you must enable debugging output first before these
settings will be effective; refer to the *SIMH User's Guide*,
"Controlling Debugging," for more information.

### UDP/IP Tunnels

In simh host interfaces are simulated using UDP connections to other
simh instances that simulate the host mainframe and run the Arpanet host
operating system. The ATTACH command is used to connect a host interface
to this other simh instance

    ATTACH HIn *tba*

The host connection may be broken with the command

    DETACH HIn

## Summary

### Additional Devices

Table 1 lists the IMP/TIP specific devices added to simh along with
their I/O address, interrupt number and vector, and DMC channel
assignment. Note that all the IMP/TIP devices use the H316 extended
interrupts and so interrupt 1, for example, corresponds to A bit 1 in
the SMK 120 instruction. Table 2 shows the extended interrupt mask
associated with these devices.

Table 5 - Other Instructions

[^1]: The modem 4 interrupt and DMC conflict with host 4 -- only one of
    the two may be active.

[^2]: The modem 5 interrupt and DMC conflict with host 3 -- only one of
    the two may be active.

[^x]: Missing reference

[^y]: Missing reference

[^3]: On simh this instruction is a NOP and never skips (simh simulates
    an H316, not the DDP-516).

[^4]: "Multi-line controller" was the official name for the TIP. MLC
    support is not implemented and this instruction is currently a NOP
    and never skips.
