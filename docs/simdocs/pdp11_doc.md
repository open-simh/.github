The DZ, VH, CR, LPT, DCI/DCO, DLI/DLO, RK, HK, RC, RF, RL, RP, RQ, RQB,
RQC, RQD, RX, RY, TA, TC, TM, TS, TQ, XQ, XQB, XU, XUB, KE, and KG
devices can be set DISABLED. DCI/DCO, DLI/DLO, RC, RF, RQB, RQC, RQD,
RY, TA, TS, VH, XQB, XU, XUB, KE, and KG are disabled by default.

The PDP-11 simulator implements several unique stop conditions:

  - Abort during exception vector fetch, and register STOP\_VEC is set

  - Abort during exception stack push, and register STOP\_SPA is set

  - Trap condition 'n' occurs, and register STOP\_TRAP\<n\> is set

  - Wait state entered, and no I/O operations outstanding (i.e., no
    interrupt can ever occur)

  - A simulated DECtape runs off the end of its reel, and flag
    STOP\_OFFR is set

The LOAD command supports standard binary format tapes. The DUMP command
is not implemented.

If a capability is standard, it cannot be disabled; if a capability is
not included, it cannot be enabled.

The CPU implements a SHOW command to display the I/O address
assignments:

SHOW CPU IOSPACE show I/O space address assignments

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 256KB. If
memory size is increased to more than 256KB, or the bus structure is
changed, the simulator disables peripherals that can't run in the
current bus structure.

These switches are recognized when examining or depositing in CPU
memory:

\-v interpret address as virtual

\-t if mem mgt enabled, force data space

\-k if mem mgt enabled, force kernel mode

\-s if mem mgt enabled, force supervisor mode

\-u if mem mgt enabled, force user mode

\-p if mem mgt enabled, force previous mode

\-b display a byte at a time rather than a word

CPU registers include the architectural state of the PDP-11 processor as
well as the control registers for the interrupt system.

The CPU attempts to detect when the simulator is idle. When idle, the
simulator does not use any resources on the host system. Idle detection
is controlled by the SET IDLE and SET NOIDLE commands:

SET CPU IDLE enable idle detection

SET CPU NOIDLE disable idle detection

Idle detection is disabled by default. The CPU is considered idle if a
WAIT instruction is executed. This will work for RSTS/E and RSX-11M+,
but not for RT-11 or UNIX.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 262144 entries.

The CPU supports a number of different breakpoint types. The default is
type -e, the usual break on instruction virtual address (PC) match.

\-e Instruction virtual address

\-p Instruction physical address

\-r Memory read virtual address

\-s Memory read physical address

\-w Memory write virtual address

\-x Memory write physical address

Instruction fetches are treated as memory reads, so a read breakpoint
will trigger for an instruction fetched from that address, not just for
a data read from that address.

In most cases, breakpoints are handled as if the instruction has not yet
executed. If necessary (for write breakpoints), state is restored from
the start of the instruction to make it appear that way. When execution
is continued, the instruction is re-executed and the previously
encountered breakpoint is suppressed for that instruction cycle. If a
given instruction encounters multiple breakpoints, for example an
instruction breakpoint for the instruction address as well as a read
breakpoint for the memory it references, both breakpoints will be seen
(the instruction will stop twice), then after the second break execution
continues past the instruction.

CIS instructions are designed to be interruptible, using the FPD bit in
the processor status word. For those instructions, a read or write
breakpoint is treated as an interrupt, so the instruction is left
partially completed. When execution continues, the instruction is
resumed from where it left off, provided the instruction state is not
modified by the user. The CIS instruction description in the PDP11
documentation spells out what the CIS state is that must be left
untouched.

Interrupts involve two reads (the vector) and two writes (the stack push
of the previous PC and PSW). Those may match memory read or write
breakpoints. If so, the interrupt setup processing is completed
normally, and the simulator stops at the first instruction of the
interrupt handler.

### System Registers (SYSTEM)

The user can check the default value with the SHOW SYSTEM JCLK\_DEFAULT
command.

## I/O Devices

### Unibus and Qbus DMA Devices

### I/O Device Addressing

PDP-11 I/O space and vector space are not large enough to allow all
possible devices to be configured simultaneously at fixed addresses.
Instead, many devices have floating addresses and vectors; that is, the
assigned device address and vector depend on the presence of other
devices in the configuration:

DZ11 all instances have floating addresses

DHU11/DHQ11 all instances have floating addresses

RL11 first instance has fixed address, rest floating

RX11/RX211 first instance has fixed address, rest floating

DEUNA/DELUA first instance has fixed address, rest floating

MSCP disk first instance has fixed address, rest floating

TMSCP tape first instance has fixed address, rest floating

In addition, some devices with fixed I/O space addresses have floating
vector addresses. DCI/DCO and DLI/DLO have floating vector addresses.

To maintain addressing consistency as the configuration changes, the
simulator implements DEC's standard I/O address and vector
autoconfiguration. This allows the user to enable or disable devices
without needing to manage I/O addresses and vectors. For example, if RY
is enabled while RX is present, RY is assigned an I/O address in the
floating I/O space range; but if RX is disabled and then RY is enabled,
RY is assigned the fixed "first instance" I/O address for floppy disks.

Autoconfiguration cannot solve address conflicts between devices with
overlapping fixed addresses. For example, with default I/O page
addressing, the PDP-11 can support either a TM11 or a TS11, but not
both, since they use the same I/O addresses.

In addition to autoconfiguration, most devices support the SET
\<device\> ADDRESS command, which allows the I/O page address of the
device to be changed, and the SET \<device\> VECTOR command, which
allows the vector of the device to be changed. Explicitly setting the
I/O address of a device that normally uses autoconfiguration DISABLES
autoconfiguration for that device and for the entire system. As a
consequence, the user may have to manually configure all other
autoconfigured devices, because the autoconfiguration algorithm no
longer recognizes the explicitly configured device. A device can be
reset to autoconfigure with the SET \<device\> AUTOCONFIGURE command.
Autoconfiguration can be restored for the entire system with the SET CPU
AUTOCONFIGURE command.

The current I/O map can be displayed with the SHOW CPU IOSPACE command.
Addresses that have set by autoconfiguration are marked with an asterisk
(\*).

All devices support the SHOW \<device\> ADDRESS and SHOW \<device\>
VECTOR commands, which display the device address and vector,
respectively.

addressing and identifies itself as an RQDX3.

Drive units have changeable unit numbers. Unit numbers can be changed
with:

Device RQ has 4 units (RQ0, RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3) which have unique MSCP
unit numbers (0, 1, 2 and 3). Device RQB has 4 units (RQB0, RQB1, RQB2
and RQB3) which have unique MSCP unit numbers (4, 5, 6 and 7). Device

INT 1 interrupt request

ITIME 1 response time for initialization steps

(except for step 4)

QTIME 24 response time for 'immediate' packets

XTIME 24 response time for data transfers

PKTS\[33\*32\] 16 packet buffers, 33W each, 32 entries

Some DEC operating systems, notably RSX11M/M+, are very sensitive to the
timing parameters. Changing the default values may cause M/M+ to crash
on boot or to hang during operation.

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached disk not ready

end of file assume rest of disk is zero

OS I/O error report error and stop

## Fixed Head Disks

### RC11 Fixed Head Disk (RC)

RC11 options include the ability to set the number of platters to a
fixed value between 1 and 4, or to autosize the number of platters:

SET RC 1P one platter (256K)

SET RC 2P two platters (512K)

SET RC 3P three platters (768K)

SET RC 4P four platters (1024K)

SET RC AUTOSIZE autosized on ATTACH

The default is one platter. The RC11 does not support the BOOT command.
The RC11 is disabled at startup and is automatically disabled in a Qbus
system.

The RC11 is a DMA device. The entire transfer occurs in a single DMA
transfer.

The RC11 implements these registers:

name size comments

RCLA 16 look ahead register

RCDA 16 current disk address

RCER 16 error register

RCCS 16 control/status

RCWC 16 word count

RCCA 16 current memory address

RCMN 16 maintenance register

RCDB 16 data buffer

RCWLK 32 write lock switches

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 device error flag

DONE 1 device done flag

IE 1 interrupt enable flag

TIME 24 rotational delay, per word

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 non-existent disk

RC11 data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O

errors cannot occur.

### RF11/RS11 Fixed Head Disk (RF)

RF11 options include the ability to set the number of platters to a
fixed value between 1 and 8, or to autosize the number of platters:

SET RF 1P one platter (256K)

SET RF 2P two platters (512K)

SET RF 3P three platters (768K)

SET RF 4P four platters (1024K)

SET RF 5P five platters (1280K)

SET RF 6P six platters (1536K)

SET RF 7P seven platters (1792K)

SET RF 8P eight platters (2048K)

SET RF AUTOSIZE autosized on ATTACH

The default is one platter. The RF11 supports the BOOT command. The RF11
is disabled at startup and is automatically disabled in a Qbus system.

The RF11 implements these registers:

name size comments

RFCS 16 control/status

RFWC 16 word count

RFCMA 16 current memory address

RFDA 16 current disk address

RFDAE 16 disk address extension

RFDBR 16 data buffer

RFMR 16 maintenance register

RFWLK 32 write lock switches

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 device error flag

DONE 1 device done flag

IE 1 interrupt enable flag

TIME 24 rotational delay, per word

BURST 1 burst flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

The RF11 is a DMA device. If BURST = 0, word transfers are scheduled
individually; if BURST = 1, the entire transfer occurs in a single DMA
transfer.

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 non-existent disk

RF11 data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.

## TC11/TU56 DECtape (DT)

The DT controller implements the TC11 DECtape controller and TU56
drives.

DECtape options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked.

SET DTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET DTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Units can be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The TC11 supports the BOOT
command. The TC11 is automatically disabled in a Qbus system.

The TC11 supports supports PDP-8 format, PDP-11 format, and 18b format
DECtape images. ATTACH assumes the image is in PDP-11 format; the user
can force other choices with switches:

\-t PDP-8 format

\-f 18b format

\-a autoselect based on file size

The DECtape controller is a data-only simulator; the timing and mark
track, and block header and trailer, are not stored. Thus, the WRITE
TIMING AND MARK TRACK function is not supported; the READ ALL function

always returns the hardware standard block header and trailer; and the
WRITE ALL function dumps non-data words into the bit bucket.

The TC controller implements these registers:

name size comments

TCST 16 status register

TCCM 16 command register

TCWC 16 word count register

TCBA 16 bus address register

TCDT 16 data register

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag

DONE 1 done flag

IE 1 interrupt enable flag

CTIME 31 time to complete transport stop

LTIME 31 time between lines

DCTIME 31 time to decelerate to a full stop

SUBSTATE 2 read/write command substate

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, in lines, units 0 to 7

STATT\[0:7\] 31 unit state, units 0 to 7

STOP\_OFFR 1 stop on off-reel error

It is critically important to maintain certain timing relationships
among the DECtape parameters, or the DECtape simulator will fail to
operate correctly.

  - LTIME must be at least 6

  - DCTIME needs to be at least 100 times LTIME

Acceleration time is set to 75% of deceleration time.

## Magnetic Tape Controllers

### TM11 Magnetic Tape (TM)

TM options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked.

SET TMn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET TMn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

SET TMn CAPAC=m set unit n capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)

SHOW TMn CAPAC show unit n capacity in MB

Units can be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The TM11 supports the BOOT command. The bootstrap supports both original
and DEC standard boot formats. Originally, a tape bootstrap read and
executed the first record on tape. To allow for ANSI labels, the DEC
standard bootstrap skipped the first record and read and executed the
second. The DEC standard is the default; to bootstrap an original format
tape, use the command BOOT –O MTn. The TM11 is automatically disabled in
a Qbus system with more than 256KB of memory.

The TM controller implements these registers:

name size comments

MTS 16 status

MTC 16 command

MTCMA 16 memory address

MTBRC 16 byte/record count

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag

DONE 1 device done flag

IE 1 interrupt enable flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

TIME 24 delay

UST\[0:7\] 16 unit status, units 0 to 7

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, units 0 to 7

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready; if STOP\_IOE, stop

end of file bad tape

OS I/O error parity error; if STOP\_IOE, stop

### TS11/TSV05 Magnetic Tape (TS)

TS options include the ability to make the unit write enabled or write
locked.

SET TS LOCKED set unit write locked

SET TS WRITEENABLED set unit write enabled

The TS drive can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

SET TS0 CAPAC=m set capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)

SHOW TS0 CAPAC show capacity in MB

The TS11 supports the BOOT command. The bootstrap supports only DEC
standard boot formats. To allow for ANSI labels, the DEC standard
bootstrap skipped the first record and read and executed the second. In
a Unibus system, the TS behaves like the TS11 and implements 18b
addresses. In a Qbus system, the TS behaves like the TSV05 and
implements 22b addresses.

The TS controller implements these registers:

name size comments

TSSR 16 status register

TSBA 16 bus address register

TSDBX 16 data buffer extension register

CHDR 16 command packet header

CADL 16 command packet low address or count

CADH 16 command packet high address

CLNT 16 command packet length

MHDR 16 message packet header

MRFC 16 message packet residual frame count

WOPT 16 write char packet options

WXOPT 16 write char packet extended options

ATTN 1 attention message pending

BOOT 1 boot request pending

OWNC 1 if set, tape owns command buffer

OWNM 1 if set, tape owns message buffer

TIME 24 delay

POS 32 position

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready

end of file bad tape

OS I/O error fatal tape error

### TQK50 TMSCP Tape Controller (TQ)

The TQ controller simulates the TQK50 TMSCP tape controller. TQ options
include the ability to set units write enabled or write locked, and to
specify the controller type and tape length:

SET TQn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET TQn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

SET TQ TK50 set controller type to TK50

SET TQ TK70 set controller type to TK70

SET TQ TU81 set controller type to TU81

SET TQ TKUSER{=n} set controller type to TK50 with

tape capacity of n MB

User-specified capacity must be between 50 and 2000 MB.

Regardless of the controller type, individual units can be set to a
specific reel capacity in MB, or to unlimited capacity:

SET TQn CAPAC=m set unit n capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)

SHOW TQn CAPAC show unit n capacity in MB

Drive units have changeable unit numbers. Unit numbers can be changed
with:

SET TQn UNIT=val set unit plug value

Device TQ has 4 units (TQ0, TQ1, TQ2 and TQ3) which have unique MSCP
unit numbers (0, 1, 2 and 3).

The TQ controller supports the BOOT command. In a Unibus system, the TQ
supports 18b addressing. In a Qbus system, the TQ supports 22b
addressing.

The TQ controller implements the following special SHOW commands:

SHOW TQ TYPE show controller type

SHOW TQ RINGS show command and response rings

SHOW TQ FREEQ show packet free queue

SHOW TQ RESPQ show packet response queue

SHOW TQ UNITQ show unit queues

SHOW TQ ALL show all ring and queue state

SHOW TQn UNITQ show unit queues for unit n

SHOW TQn UNIT show unit plug value

The TQ controller implements these registers:

name size comments

SA 16 status/address register

S1DAT 16 step 1 init host data

CQBA 22 command queue base address

CQLNT 8 command queue length

CQIDX 8 command queue index

RQBA 22 request queue base address

(except for step 4)

QTIME 24 response time for 'immediate' packets

XTIME 24 response time for data transfers

PKTS\[33\*32\] 16 packet buffers, 33W each, 32 entries

Some DEC operating systems, notably RSX11M/M+, are very sensitive to the
timing parameters. Changing the default values may cause M/M+ to crash
on boot or to hang during operation.

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready

end of file end of medium

OS I/O error fatal tape error

## Communications Devices

### DC11 Additional Terminal Interfaces (DCI/DCO)

For very early system programs, the PDP-11 simulator supports up to
sixteen additional DC11 terminal interfaces. The additional terminals
consist of two independent devices, DCI and DCO. The entire set is
modeled as a terminal multiplexer, with DCI as the master controller.
The additional terminals perform input and output through Telnet
sessions connected to a user-specified port. The number of lines is
specified with a SET command:

SET DCIX LINES=n set number of additional lines to n \[1-16\]

The ATTACH command specifies the port to be used:

ATTACH DCIX \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. The additional terminals are disabled
by default.

The additional terminals can be set to one of four modes: UC, 7P, 7B, or
8B.

mode input characters output characters

UC lower case converted lower case converted to upper case,

to upper case, high-order bit cleared,

high-order bit cleared non-printing characters suppressed

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default mode is 7P. In addition, each line can be configured to
behave as though it was attached to a dataset, or hardwired to a
terminal:

SET DCOn DATASET simulate attachment to a dataset (modem)

SET DCOn NODATASET simulate direct attachment to a terminal

Finally, each line supports output logging. The SET DCOn LOG command
enables logging on a line:

SET DCOn LOG=filename log output of line n to filename

The SET DCOn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once DCI is attached and the simulator is running, the terminals listen
for connections on the specified port. They assume that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET DCI DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH DCI command.

Other special commands:

> SHOW DCI CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW DCI STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET DCOn DISCONNECT disconnects the specified line.

The input device (DCI) implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR\[0:15\] 16 input control/stats register, lines 0 to 15

BUF\[0:15\] 16 input buffer, lines 0 to 15

IREQ 16 interrupt requests, lines 0 to 15

The output device (DCO) implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR\[0:15\] 16 input control/stats register, lines 0 to 15

BUF\[0:15\] 8 input buffer, lines 0 to 15

IREQ 16 interrupt requests, lines 0 to 15

TIME\[0:15\] 31 time from I/O initiation to interrupt,

lines 0 to 15

The additional terminals do not support save and restore. All open
connections are lost when the simulator shuts down or DCI is detached.

### KL11/DL11 Additional Terminal Interfaces (DLI/DLO)

The PDP-11 simulator supports up to sixteen additional KL11/DL11
terminal interfaces. The additional terminals consist of two independent
devices, DLI and DLO. The entire set is modeled as a terminal
multiplexer, with DLI as the master controller. The additional terminals
perform input and output through Telnet sessions connected to a
user-specified port. The number of lines is specified with a SET
command:

SET DLI LINES=n set number of additional lines to n \[1-16\]

The ATTACH command specifies the port to be used:

ATTACH DLI \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. The additional terminals are disabled
by default.

The additional terminals can be set to one of four modes: UC, 7P, 7B, or
8B.

mode input characters output characters

UC lower case converted lower case converted to upper case,

to upper case, high-order bit cleared,

high-order bit cleared non-printing characters suppressed

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

SET DLOn UC set UC mode

SET DLOn 7P set 7P mode

SET DLOn 7B set 7B mode

SET DLOn 8B set 8B mode

The default mode is UC. In addition, each line can be configured to
behave as though it was attached to a dataset, or hardwired to a
terminal:

SET DLOn DATASET simulate attachment to a dataset (modem)

SET DLOn NODATASET simulate direct attachment to a terminal

Finally, each line supports output logging. The SET DLOn LOG command
enables logging on a line:

SET DLOn LOG=filename log output of line n to filename

The SET DLOn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once DLI is attached and the simulator is running, the terminals listen
for connections on the specified port. They assume that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET DLI DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH DLI command.

Other special commands:

> SHOW DLI CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW DLI STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET DLOn DISCONNECT disconnects the specified line.

The input device (DLI) implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR\[0:15\] 16 input control/stats register, lines 0 to 15

BUF\[0:15\] 16 input buffer, lines 0 to 15

IREQ 16 receive interrupt requests, lines 0 to 15

DSI 16 dataset interrupt requests, lines 0 to 15

The output device (DLO) implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR\[0:15\] 16 input control/stats register, lines 0 to 15

BUF\[0:15\] 8 input buffer, lines 0 to 15

IREQ 16 interrupt requests, lines 0 to 15

TIME\[0:15\] 31 time from I/O initiation to interrupt,

lines 0 to 15

The additional terminals do not support save and restore. All open
connections are lost when the simulator shuts down or DLO is detached.

### DZ11 Terminal Multiplexer (DZ)

The DZ11 is an 8-line terminal multiplexer. Up to 4 DZ11's (32 lines)
are supported. The number of lines can be changed with the command

SET DZ LINES=n set line count to n

The line count must be a multiple of 8, with a maximum of 32.

The DZ11 supports three character processing modes, 7P, 7B, and 8B:

mode input characters output characters

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default is 8B.

The DZ11 supports logging on a per-line basis. The command

SET DZ LOG=line=filename

enables logging for the specified line to the indicated file. The
command

SET DZ NOLOG=line

disables logging for the specified line and closes any open log file.
Finally, the command

SHOW DZ LOG

displays logging information for all DZ lines.

The terminal lines perform input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command specifies the
port to be used:

ATTACH {-am} DZ \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. The optional switch -m turns on the
DZ11's modem controls; the optional switch -a turns on active
disconnects (disconnect session if computer clears Data Terminal Ready).
Without modem control, the DZ behaves as though terminals were directly
connected; disconnecting the Telnet session does not cause any operating
system-visible change in line status.

Once the DZ is attached and the simulator is running, the DZ will listen
for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connection remains open until
disconnected by the simulated program, the Telnet client, a SET DZ
DISCONNECT command, or a DETACH DZ command.

Other special DZ commands:

> SHOW DZ CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW DZ STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET DZ DISCONNECT=linenumber disconnects the specified line.

The DZ11 implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR\[0:3\] 16 control/status register, boards 0 to 3

RBUF\[0:3\] 16 receive buffer, boards 0 to 3

LPR\[0:3\] 16 line parameter register, boards 0 to 3

TCR\[0:3\] 16 transmission control register, boards 0 to 3

MSR\[0:3\] 16 modem status register, boards 0 to 3

TDR\[0:3\] 16 transmit data register, boards 0 to 3

SAENB\[0:3\] 1 silo alarm enabled, boards 0 to 3

RXINT 4 receive interrupts, boards 3..0

TXINT 4 transmit interrupts, boards 3..0

MDMTCL 1 modem control enabled

AUTODS 1 autodisconnect enabled

The DZ11 does not support save and restore. All open connections are
lost when the simulator shuts down or the DZ is detached.

### DHQ11 Terminal Multiplexer (VH)

The DHQ11 is an 8-line terminal multiplexer for Qbus systems. Up to 4
DHQ11's are supported.

The DHQ11 is a programmable asynchronous terminal multiplexer. It has
two programming modes: DHV11 and DHU11. The register sets are compatible
with these devices. For transmission, the DHQ11 can be used in either
DMA or programmed I/O mode. For reception, there is a 256-entry FIFO for
received characters, dataset status changes, and diagnostic information,
and a programmable input interrupt timer (in DHU mode). The device
supports 16-, 18-, and 22-bit addressing. The DHQ11 can be programmed to
filter and/or handle XON/XOFF characters independently of the processor.
The DHQ11 supports programmable bit width (between 5 and 8) for the
input and output of characters.

The DHQ11 has a rocker switch for determining the programming mode. By
default, the DHV11 mode is selected, though DHU11 mode is recommended
for applications that can support it. The VH controller may be adjusted
on a per controller basis as follows:

SET VHn DHU use the DHU programming mode and registers

SET VHn DHV use the DHV programming mode and registers

DMA output is supported. In a real DHQ11, DMA is not initiated
immediately upon receipt of TX.DMA.START but is dependent upon some
internal processes. The VH controller mimics this behavior by default.
It may be desirable to alter this and start immediately, though this may
not be compatible with all operating systems and diagnostics. You can
change the behavior of the VH controller as follows:

SET VHn NORMAL use normal DMA procedures

SET VHn FASTDMA set DMA to initiate immediately

The terminal lines perform input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command specifies the
port to be used:

ATTACH VH \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. This port is the point of entry for
all lines on all VH controllers.

The number of lines can be changed with the command

SET VH LINES=n set line count to n

The line count must be a multiple of 8, with a maximum of 32.

Modem and auto-disconnect support may be set on an individual controller
basis. The SET MODEM command directs the controller to report modem
status changes to the computer. The SET HANGUP command turns on active
disconnects (disconnect session if computer clears Data Terminal Ready).

SET VHn \[NO\]MODEM disable/enable modem control

SET VHn \[NO\]HANGUP disable/enable disconnect on DTR drop

Once the VH is attached and the simulator is running, the VH will listen
for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connection remains open until
disconnected by the simulated program, the Telnet client, a SET VH
DISCONNECT command, or a DETACH VH command.

Other special VH commands:

> SHOW VH CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW VH STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET VH DISCONNECT=linenumber disconnects the specified line.

The DHQ11 implements these registers, though not all can be examined
from SCP:

name size comments

CSR\[0:3\] 16 control/status register, boards 0 to 3

RBUF\[0:3\] 16 receive buffer, boards 0 to 3

LPR\[0:3\] 16 line parameter register, boards 0 to 3

RXINT 4 receive interrupts, boards 3..0

TXINT 4 transmit interrupts, boards 3..0

\[more to be described...\]

The DHQ11 does not support save and restore. All open connections are
lost when the simulator shuts down or the VH is detached.

## Ethernet Controllers

### DELQA-T/DELQA/DEQNA Qbus Ethernet Controllers (XQ, XQB)

The simulator implements two DELQA-T/DELQA/DEQNA Qbus Ethernet
controllers (XQ, XQB). Initially, XQ is enabled, and XQB is disabled.
Options allow control of the MAC address, the controller mode, and the
sanity timer.

SET XQ MAC=\<mac-address\> ex. 08-00-2B-AA-BB-CC

SHOW XQ MAC

These commands are used to change or display the MAC address.
\<mac-address\> is a valid Ethernet MAC, delimited by dashes or periods.
The controller defaults to 08-00-2B-AA-BB-CC, which should be sufficient
if there is only one SIMH controller on your LAN. Two cards with the
same MAC address will see each other's packets, resulting in a serious
mess.

SET XQ TYPE={DEQNA|\[DELQA\]|DELQA-T}

SHOW XQ TYPE

These commands are used to change or display the controller mode. DELQA
mode is better and faster but may not be usable by older or non-DEC
OS's. Also, be aware that DEQNA mode is not supported by many modern
OS's. The DEQNA-LOCK mode of the DELQA card is emulated by setting the
the controller to DEQNA -- there is no need for a separate mode.
DEQNA-LOCK mode behaves exactly like a DEQNA, except for the operation
of the VAR and MOP processing.

SET XQ SANITY={ON|\[OFF\]}

SHOW XQ SANITY

These commands change or display the INITIALIZATION sanity timer (DEQNA
jumper W3/DELQA switch S4). The INITIALIZATION sanity timer has a
default timeout of 4 minutes, and cannot be turned off, just reset. The
normal sanity timer can be set by operating system software regardless
of the state of this switch. Note that only the DEQNA (or the DELQA in
DEQNA-LOCK mode (=DEQNA)) supports the sanity timer -- it is ignored by
a DELQA in Normal mode, which uses switch S4 for a different purpose.

SET XQ POLL={DEFAULT|4..2500}

SHOW XQ POLL

These commands change or display the service polling timer. The polling
timer is calibrated to run the service thread 200 times per second. This
value can be changed to accommodate particular system requirements for
more (or less) frequent polling.

SHOW XQ STATS

This command will display the accumulated statistics for the simulated
Ethernet controller.

To access the network, the simulated Ethernet controller must be
attached to a real Ethernet interface:

ATTACH XQ0 {ethX|\<device\_name\>} ex. eth0 or /dev/era0

SHOW XQ ETH

where X in 'ethX' is the number of the Ethernet controller to attach, or
the real device name. The X number is system-dependent. If you only have
one Ethernet controller, the number will probably be 0. To find out what
your system thinks the Ethernet numbers are, use the SHOW XQ ETH
command. The device list can be quite cryptic, depending on the host
system, but is probably better than guessing. If you do not attach the
device, the controller will behave as though the Ethernet cable were
unplugged.

XQ and XQB have the following registers:

name size comments

SA0 16 station address word 0

SA1 16 station address word 1

SA2 16 station address word 2

SA3 16 station address word 3

SA4 16 station address word 4

SA5 16 station address word 5

RBDL 32 receive buffer descriptor list

XBDL 32 trans(X)mit buffer descriptor list

CSR 16 control status register

VAR 16 vector address register

INT 1 interrupt request flag

One final note: because of its asynchronous nature, the XQ controller is
not limited to the \~1.5Mbit/sec of the real DEQNA/DELQA controllers,
nor the 10Mbit/sec of a standard Ethernet. Attach it to a Fast Ethernet
(100 Mbit/sec) card, and "Feel the Power\!" :-)

### DELUA/DEUNA Unibus Ethernet Controllers (XU, XUB)

The simulator implements two DELUA/DEUNA Unibus Ethernet controllers
(XU, XUB). Its operation is analogous to the DELQA/DEQNA controller.

## CR11/CD11 Card Reader (CR)

The card reader (CR) implements a single controller (either the CR11 or
the CD11) and card reader (e.g., Documation M200, GDI Model 100) by
reading a file and presenting lines or cards to the simulator. Card
decks may be represented by plain text ASCII files, card image files, or
column binary files. The CR11 controller is also compatible with the
CM11-F, CME11, and CMS11.

Card image files are a file format designed by Douglas W. Jones at the
University of Iowa to support the interchange of card deck data. These
files have a much richer information carrying capacity than plain ASCII
files. Card Image files can contain such interchange information as
card-stock color, corner cuts, special artwork, as well as the binary
punch data representing all 12 columns. Complete details on the format,
as well as sample code, are available at Prof. Jones's site:
http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/\~jones/cards/.

The card reader can be configured to support either of the two
controllers supported by DEC:

SET CR CR11 set controller type to CR11

SET CR CD11 set controller type to CD11

The controller type must be set before attaching a virtual card deck to
the device. You may NOT change controller type once a file is attached.

The primary differences are summarized in the table below. By default,
the CR11 simulation is selected.

CR11 CD11

BR 6 4

registers 4 3

data transfer BR DMA

card rate 200-600 1000-1200

hopper cap. \<= 1000 1000-2250

cards Mark-sense & punched only

punched

Examples of the CR11 include the M8290 and M8291 (CMS11). All card
readers use a common vector at 0230 and CSR at 177160.

The card reader supports ASCII, card image, and column binary format
card “decks.” When reading plain ASCII files, lines longer than 80
characters are silently truncated. Card image support is included for 80
column Hollerith, 82 column Hollerith (silently ignoring columns 0 and
81), and 40 column Hollerith (mark-sense) cards. Column binary supports
80 column card images only. All files are attached read-only (as if the
-R switch were given).

ATTACH –A CR \<file\> file is ASCII text

ATTACH –B CR \<file\> file is column binary

ATTACH –I CR \<file\> file is card image format

If no flags are given, the file extension is evaluated. If the filename
ends in .TXT, the file is treated as ASCII text. If the filename ends in
.CBN, the file is treated as column binary. Otherwise, the CR driver
looks for a card image header. If a correct header is found the file is
treated as card image format, otherwise it is treated as ASCII text.

The correct character translation MUST be set if a plain text file is to
be used for card deck input. The correct translation SHOULD be set to
allow correct ASCII debugging of a card image or column binary input
deck. Depending upon the operating system in use, how it was generated,
and how the card data will be read and used, the translation must be set
correctly so that the proper character set is used by the driver. Use
the following command to explicitly set the correct translation:

SET TRANSLATION={DEFAULT|026|026FTN|029|EBCDIC}

This command should be given after a deck is attached to the simulator.
The mappings above are completely described at
http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/\~jones/cards/codes.html. Note that DEC
typically used 029 or 026FTN mappings.

DEC operating systems used a variety of methods to determine the end of
a deck, recognizing that 'hopper empty' does not necessarily mean the
end of a deck. Below is a summary of the various operating system
conventions for signaling end of deck:

RT-11: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

RSTS/E: 12-11-0-1 or 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

RSX: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch

VMS: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in first 8 columns

TOPS: 12-11-0-1 or 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

Using the AUTOEOF setting, the card reader can be set to automatically
generate an EOF card consisting of the 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in
columns 1-8. When set to CD11 mode, this switch also enables automatic
setting of the EOF bit in the controller after the EOF card has been
processed. \[The CR11 does not have a similar capability.\] By default
AUTOEOF is enabled.

SET CR AUTOEOF

SET CR NOAUTOEOF

The default card reader rate for the CR11 is 285 cpm, while the default
rate for the CD11 is 1000 cpm. The reader rate can be set to its default
value or to anywhere in the range 200..1200 cpm. This rate may be
changed while the unit is attached.

SET CR RATE={DEFAULT|200..1200}

It is standard operating procedure for operators to load a card deck and
press the momentary action RESET button to clear any error conditions
and alert the processor that a deck is available to read. Use the
following command to simulate pressing the card reader RESET button,

SET CR RESET

Another common control of physical card readers is the STOP button. An
operator could use this button to finish the read operation for the
current card and terminate reading a deck early. Use the following
command to simulate pressing the card reader STOP button.

SET CR STOP

The simulator does not support the BOOT command. The simulator does not
stop on file I/O errors. Instead the controller signals a reader check
to the CPU.

The CR controller implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 ASCII value of last column processed

CRS 16 CR11 status register

CRB1 16 CR11 12-bit Hollerith character

CRB2 16 CR11 8-bit compressed character

CRM 16 CR11 maintenance register

CDST 16 CD11 control/status register

CDCC 16 CD11 column count

CDBA 16 CD11 current bus address

CDDB 16 CD11 data buffer, 2nd status

BLOWER 2 blower state value

INTCR 1 interrupt pending flag (CR11)

INTCD 1 interrupt pending flag (CD11)

ERR 1 error flag (CRS\<15\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CRS\<6\>)

POS 32 file position - do not alter

TIME 24 delay time between columns

The CD11 simulation includes the Rev. J modification to make the CDDB
act as a second status register during non-data transfer periods.

## Arithmetic Options

### KE11A Extended Arithmetic Option (KE)

The KE11A extended arithmetic option (KE) provides multiply, divide,
normalization, and multi-bit shift capability on Unibus PDP-11’s that
lack the EIS instruction set. In practice, it was only sold with the
PDP-11/20. The KE is disabled by default.

The KE implements these registers:

name size comments

AC 16 accumulator

MQ 16 multiplier-quotient

SC 6 shift count

SR 8 status register

### KG11A Communications Arithmetic Option (KG)

The KG11-A is a programmed I/O, non-interrupting, dedicated arithmetic
processor for the Unibus.  The device is used to compute the block check
character (BCC) over a block of data, typically in data communication
applications.  The KG11 can compute three different Cyclic Redundancy
Check (CRC) polynomials (CRC-16, CRC-12, CRC-CCITT) and two Longitudinal
Redundancy Checks (LRC, Exclusive-OR; LRC-8, LRC-16).  Up to eight units
may be contiguously present in a single machine and are all located at
fixed addresses.  This simulation implements all functionality of the
device including the ability to single step computation of the BCC. The
KG is disabled by default.  
  
The KG11 supports the following options:  
  
        SET KG UNITS=n            set the number of units \[0-8\]  
        SET KG DEBUG={opt,opt…}   set the debugging options  
                                    REG - any time a register is
touched  
                                    POLY - any time the polynomial is
changed  
                                    CYCLE - each cycle computing the
polynomial  
  
The KG11 implements the following registers, replicated for each unit:  
  
        name            size        comments  
  
        SR\[0:7\]         16          control and status register; R/W  
        BCC\[0:7\]        16          result block check character;
R/O  
        DR\[0:7\]         16          input data register; W/O  
        PULSCNT\[0:7\]    16          polynomial cycle stage

# Symbolic Display and Input

The PDP-11 simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

\-a display as ASCII character

\-c display as two packed ASCII characters

\-m display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

' or -a ASCII character

" or -c two packed ASCII characters

alphabetic instruction mnemonic

numeric octal number

Instruction input uses standard PDP-11 assembler syntax. There are
sixteen instruction classes:

class operands examples comments

no operands none HALT, RESET

3b literal literal \[0 to 7\] SPL

6b literal literal \[0-077\] MARK

8b literal literal \[0-0377\] EMT, TRAP

register register RTS

sop specifier SWAB, CLR, ASL

reg-sop register, specifier JSR, XOR, MUL

fop flt specifier ABSf, NEGf

ac-fop flt reg, flt specifier LDf, MULf

ac-sop flt reg, specifier LDEXP, STEXP

ac-moded sop flt reg, specifier LDCif, STCfi

dop specifier, specifier MOV, ADD, BIC

cond branch address BR, BCC, BNE

sob register, address SOB

cc clear cc clear instructions CLC, CLV, CLZ, CLN combinable

cc set cc set instructions SEC, SEV, SEZ, SEN combinable

For floating point opcodes, F and D variants, and I and L variants, may
be specified regardless of the state of FPS.

The syntax for specifiers is as follows:

syntax specifier displacement comments

Rn 0n -

Fn 0n - only in flt reg classes

.+/-n 67 +/-n - 4

@.+/-n 77 +/-n - 4

{+/-}n 67 {+/-}n - PC - 4 if on disk, 37 and n

@{+/-}n 77 {+/-}n - PC - 4 if on disk, invalid

# The UC15

The UC15 is a special, limited configuration of the PDP-11 simulator for
use as the I/O processor in a PDP-15/76 system. It is configured as
follows:

> device name(s) simulates
> 
> CPU PDP-11/05 CPU with 8KB-24KB of memory
> 
> PTR,PTP PC11 paper tape reader/punch
> 
> TTI,TTO DL11 console terminal
> 
> CR CR11 card reader
> 
> LPT LP11 line printer
> 
> CLK KW11-L line frequency clock
> 
> RK RK11/RK05 cartridge disk controller with eight drives
> 
> UCA,UCB DR11-C parallel interfaces

The card reader is disabled initially and is not supported by the
default release of PIREX, the I/O executive that runs in the UC15.

The CPU model cannot be changed. While memory size can be changed, PIREX
is configured for 16KB of memory.

The PDP-15/76 configuration requires the shared memory facility, which
is presently implemented only for Windows and Linux.

## DR11 Parallel Interfaces (UCA, UCB)

The UC15 talks to the PDP-15’s DR15 interface over a pair of DR11-C
interfaces called UCA and UCB. UCA implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR 16 control/status register

BUF 16 input buffer

APID 1 CSR\<7\>, API done

IE 1 CSR\<6\>, interrupt enable

POLL 10 polling interval

UCB implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR 16 control/status register

BUF 16 input buffer

NTCB 1 CSR\<7\>, new task control block

IE 1 CSR\<6\>, interrupt enable

UCA and UCB implement the SET/SHOW ADDRESS and SET/SHOW VECTOR commands,
but if the address or vector of either interface is changed, PIREX will
not run correctly.
