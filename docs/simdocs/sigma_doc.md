Most devices can be disabled or enabled with the SET \<dev\> DISABLED
and SET \<dev\> ENABLED commands, respectively.

The LOAD and DUMP commands are not implemented.

## Central Processor (CPU)

Central processor options include the CPU model, the CPU features, and
the size of main memory.

SET CPU SIGMA5 set CPU model to Sigma 5

SET CPU SIGMA6 set CPU model to Sigma 6

SET CPU SIGMA7 set CPU model to Sigma 7

SET CPU SIGMA7B set CPU model to Sigma 7 “big” memory

SET CPU SIGMA8 set CPU Model to Sigma 8

SET CPU SIGMA9 set CPU model to Sigma 9

SET CPU 550 set CPU model to 550

SET CPU 560 set CPU model to 560

SET CPU FP enable floating point, if available

SET CPU NOFP disable floating point, if optional

SET CPU DECIMAL enable decimal, if available

SET CPU NODECIMAL disable decimal, if optional

SET CPU LASLAM enable LAS/LAM instructions (6/7 only)

SET CPU NOLASLAM disable LAS/LAM instructions

SET CPU MAP enable memory map, if available

SET CPU NOMAP disable memory map, if optional

SET CPU WRITELOCK enable write locks, if available

SET CPU NOWRITELOCK disable write locks, if optional

SET CPU RBLKS=n set number of register blocks

SET CPU CHAN=n set number of channels

SET CPU 32K set memory size = 32KW

SET CPU 64K set memory size = 64KW

SET CPU 128K set memory size = 64KW

SET CPU 256K set memory size = 256KW

SET CPU 512K set memory size = 512KW

SET CPU 1M set memory size = 1024KW

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial configuration is Sigma 7
CPU, 4 channels, 128KW of memory, floating point, decimal, map and
writelocks options enabled.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

name size comments

PC 17 program counter

R0..R15 32 active general registers

PSW1 32 processor status word 1

PSW2 32 processor status word 2

PSW4 32 processor status word 4 (5x0 only)

CC 4 condition codes

RP 5 register block selector

SSW1..SSW4 1 sense switches

PDF 1 processor fault flag

ALARM 1 console alarm

ALENB 1 console alarm enable

PCF 1 console controlled flop

EXULIM 8 limit for nested EXU’s

STOP\_ILL 1 if 1, stop on undefined instruction

REG 512 register blocks, 32 x 16

WRU 8 interrupt character

The CPU provides an address converter to display the byte (halfword,
word, or doubleword) address equivalent of a byte (halfword, word, or
doubleword) input address. Optionally, the input address can be run
through memory relocation:

SHOW {-flags} CPU {BA,HA,WA,DA}=address

BA, HA, WA, DA specify that the input address is a byte, halfword, word,
or doubleword address, respectively. The flags are:

\-v input address is virtual

\-b output is byte address

\-h output is halfword address

\-w output is word address (default)

\-d output is doubleword address

For example:

SHOW –B CPU WA=100

Physical word 100: physical byte 400

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 1M entries.

## Memory Map (MAP)

The memory map implements two distinct forms of protection: memory
mapping and access protection on virtual addresses; and write lock
protection on physical addresses. It also includes a skeleton
implementation of the memory status registers from the Sigma 8 and 9,
and the XDS 550 and 560. It implements these registers:

name size comments

REL\[0:511\] 11 relocation registers

ACC\[0:511\] 2 access controls

WLK\[0:2047\] 4 write locks

SR0\[32\] 32 memory status register 0

SR1\[32\] 32 memory status register 1

## Interrupt System (INT)

The Sigma series implements a complex, multi-level interrupts system,
with a minimum of 32 distinct interrupts. The interrupt system can be
expanded to up to 224 interrupt levels. It implements these registers:

name size comments

IHIACT 9 highest active interrupt level

IHIREQ 9 highest outstanding interrupt request

IREQ\[0:15\] 16 interrupt requests

IENB\[0:15\] 16 interrupt enabled flags

IARM\[0:15\] 16 interrupt armed flags

S9\_SNAP 32 Sigma 9 snapshot register

S9\_MARG 32 Sigma 9 margins registers

S5X0\_IREG\[0:31\] 32 5X0 internal registers (unused)

The simulator supports a variable number of external interrupt blocks.
The minimum number is one, the maximum is four (5X0) to thirty-two
(Sigma 7). The user can change the number of external interrupt blocks
with the SET INT EIBLKS command:

SET INT EIBLKS=4 configure four external interrupt blocks

Although the Sigma series supports configurable interrupt group
priorities, the simulator uses a fixed priority arrangement, high to low
as follows:

  - counters

  - counter overflow

  - I/O and panel interrupt

  - external group 2 (there is no external group 1)

  - external group 3

  - etc.

## Channels (CHANA .. CHANH)

A Sigma 32b system has up to eight I/O channels, designated A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, and H. The association between a device and a channel is
displayed by the SHOW \<dev\> CHAN command and SHOW \<dev\> DVA command:

SHOW MT CHAN

channel=A

SHOW MT DVA

address=00

The user can change the association with the SET \<dev\> CHAN=\<chan\>
command, where \<chan\> is a channel letter, and with the SET \<dev\>
DVA=\<addr\> command, where \<addr\> is a legal device address:

SET MT CHAN=C

SET MT DVA=4

SHOW MT CHAN,DVA

channel=B

address=04

The default channel assignments for the simulator are:

Device Channel Address

MT chan A address 0

TT chan A address 1

LP chan A address 2

PT chan A address 5

COC chan A address 6

RAD chan B address 0

DK chan B address 1

DPA chan C address 0

DPB chan D address 1

The user can display all the channel registers associated with a device
with the SHOW \<dev\> CSTATE command:

SHOW MT CSTATE

Each channel has eight registers. The registers are arrays, with entry 1
for device \[0\], entry \[1\] for device 1, etc. A channel supports a
maximum of 32 devices.

name size comments

CLC\[0:31\] 16 channel location counter (doubleword)

CMD\[0:31\] 8 current channel command

CMF\[0:31\] 8 channel command flags

BA\[0:31\] 24 byte address (byte)

BC\[0:31\] 16 byte count

CMF\[0:31\] 16 channel status flags

CHI\[0:31\] 8 channel interrupt flags

CHSF\[0:31\] 8 channel simulator flags

## 7012 Console Teletype (TT)

The console Teletype (TT) consists of two units. Unit 0 is for console
input, unit 1 for console output. The console implements these
registers:

name size comments

KPOS 32 number of characters input

TPOS 32 number of characters input

TTIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

PANEL 8 character code for panel interrupt

The PANEL variable defaults to control-P. If the user types the control
panel character, it is not echoed; instead, a control panel interrupt is
generated.

The console can be set to one of two modes, 7P or UC:

mode input characters output characters

UC lower case converted lower case converted

to upper case to upper case

7P non-printing characters suppressed

The default mode is UC. The console character set is a subset of EBCDIC.
By default, the console is assigned to channel A as device 1.

## 7060 Paper Tape Reader (PT)

The paper tape controller implements two units. Unit 0 (PT0) is for
paper tape input, unit 1 (PT1) for paper tape output. Paper tapes are
simulated as disk files. For the reader, register RPOS specifies the
number of the next data item to be read. For the punch, register PPOS
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing RPOS or PPOS, the user can backspace or advance the reader or
punch.

The paper tape controller implements these registers:

name size comments

CMD 9 current command or state

NZC 1 non-zero character seen since ATTACH

RPOS 32 position in the reader input file

RTIME 24 time from reader I/O initiation to response

RSTOP\_IOE 1 stop on reader I/O error

PPOS 32 position in the punch output file

PTIME 24 time from punch I/O initiation to response

PSTOP\_IOE 1 punch stop on I/O error

The paper-tape reader supports the BOOT command. BOOT PT0 simulates the
standard console fill sequence.

Reader error handling is as follows:

error RSTOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

end of file 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

Punch error handling is as follows:

error PSTOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

By default, the paper tape reader is assigned to channel A as device 5.

## 7440 or 7450 Line Printer (LP)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer.

The line printer implements these registers:

name size comments

CMD 9 current command or state

BUF\[0:131\] 7 data buffer

PASS 1 printing pass (7440 only)

INH 1 inhibit spacing flag

RUNAWAY 1 runaway carriage-control tape flag

CCT\[0:131\] 8 carriage control tape

CCTP 8 pointer into carriage control tape

CCTL 8 length of carriage control tape

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to response

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

The line printer model can be set to either the 7440 or the 7450:

SET LP 7440 set model to 7440

SET LP 7450 set model to 7450

The default model is the 7450.

A carriage control tape can be loaded with the SET LP CCT command:

SET LP CCT=\<file\> load carriage-control tape from \<file\>

The format of a carriage control tape consists of multiple lines. Each
line contains an optional repeat count, enclosed in parentheses,
optionally followed by a series of column numbers separated by commas.
Column numbers must be between 0 and 7. The following are all legal
carriage control specifications:

\<blank line\> no punch

(5) 5 lines with no punches

1,5,7 columns 1, 5, 78 punched

(10)2 10 lines with column 2 punched

1 column 1 punched

The default form is 1 line long, with every column punched.

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

By default, the line printer is assigned to channel A as device 2.

## Real-Time Clock (RTC)

The Sigma 32b series implements four real-time clocks. Three of them can
be set to a variety of frequencies, including off, 50Hz, 60Hz, 100Hz,
and 500hz. The fourth always runs at 500Hz. The frequency of each clock
can be can be adjusted as follows:

SET RTC {C1,C2,C3}=freq set clock 1/2/3 to specified frequency

The frequency of each clock can be display as follows:

SHOW RTC {C1,C2,C3,C4} show clock 1/2/3/4 frequency

Clocks 1 and 2 default to off, clocks 3 and 4 to 500Mhz.

The RTC can also show the state of all real-time events in the
simulator:

SHOW RTC EVENTS

The real-time clocks autocalibrate; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

## Character-Oriented Communications Subsystem (MUX)

The character-oriented communications subsystem implements up to 64
asynchronous interfaces, with modem control. The subsystem has two
controllers: MUX for the scanner, and MUXL for the individual lines. The
terminal multiplexer performs input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command specifies the
port to be used:

ATTACH MUX \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Unlike the console, the MUX operates in ASCII. Each line (each unit of
MUXL) supports four character processing modes: UC, 7P, 7B, and 8B.

mode input characters output characters

UC high-order bit cleared, high-order bit cleared,

lower case converted lower case converted

to upper case to upper case

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default is UC. In addition, each line supports output logging. The
SET MUXLn LOG command enables logging on a line:

SET MUXLn filename log output of line n to filename

The SET MUXLn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once MUX is attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer
listens for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the
incoming connections are Telnet connections. The connections remain open
until

disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET MUX DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH MUX command.

Other special multiplexer commands:

> SHOW MUX CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW MUX STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET MUXLn DISCONNECT disconnects the specified line.

The controller (MUX) implements these registers:

name size comments

STA\[0:63\] 8 status, lines 0 to 63

RBUF\[0:63\] 8 receive buffer, lines 0 to 63

XBUF\[0:63\] 8 transmit buffer, lines 0 to 63

SCAN 6 current scanner line

SLCK 1 scanner locked flag

CMD 2 channel command or state

The lines (MUXL) implements these registers:

name size comments

TIME\[0:63\] 24 transmit time, lines 0 to 31

The terminal multiplexer does not support save and restore. All open
connections are lost when the simulator shuts down or MUX is detached.
By default, the multiplexer is assigned to channel A as device 6.

## 7240, 7270, 7260, 7265, 7275, and T3281 Moving Head Disk Controllers (DPA, DPB)

The Sigma 32b series supports two moving head disk controllers (DPA,
DPB). Each can be set to model one of six controllers (7240, 7270, 7260,
7265, 7275, or Telefile 3281):

SET DP{A,B} 7240 set DPA (or DPB) to 7240

SET DP{A,B} 7270 set DPA (or DPB) to 7270

SET DP{A,B} 7260 set DPA (or DPB) to 7260

SET DP{A,B} 7265 set DPA (or DPB) to 7265

SET DP{A,B} 7275 set DPA (or DPB) to 7275

SET DP{A,B} T3281 set DPA (or DPB) to Telefile 3281

The default for DPA is the 7270, for DPB, the 3T281.

The 7240 and 7270 support up to 8 7242 and 7271 drives, respectively.
The 7260, 7265, and 7275 support up to 15 7261, 7266, and 7276 drives,
respectively. The T3281 supports up to 15 drives of three different
types, which can be mixed:

Model Cylinders Heads Sectors

3288 17 5 823

3282 11 19 815

3283 17 19 815

The command to set a drive to a particular model is:

SET DPn \<drive\_type\> SET unit n to the specified drive type

The T3281 can also be set to autosize on ATTACH:

SET DPn AUTO SET unit n to autosize on ATTACH

Units can be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The DP controller supports the
BOOT command.

The DP controllers implements the registers listed below. Registers
suffixed with \[0:14\] are replicated per drive.

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

end of file x assume rest of disk is zero

OS I/O error x report error and stop

By default, DPA is assigned to channel C as device 0, and DPB is
assigned to channel D as device 0.

## 7250 Cartridge Disk Controller (DK)

The cartridge disk controller (DK) supports up to 8 drives. DK options
include the ability to make drives write enabled or write locked:

SET DKn LOCKED set drive n write locked

SET DKn WRITEENABLED set drive n write enabled

The cartridge disk controller implements these registers:

name size comments

CMD 9 current command or state

FLAGS 8 controller flags

ADDR 8 current disk address

TIME 24 interval between data transfers

STIME 24 seek interval

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 non-existent disk

DK data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS I/O
errors cannot occur. By default, the cartridge disk controller is
assigned to channel B as device 1.

## 7211/7212 or 7231/7232 Fixed Head Disk (RAD)

The Sigma 32b series supports two models of fixed head disk:

7211/7212 1.343MW

7231/7232 1.572MW

The user can select the model as follows:

SET RAD 7211 set model to 7211/7212

SET RAD 7231 set model to 7231/7232

The fixed head disk controller supports four units (drives). Units can
be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The fixed head disk controller implements these registers:

CMD 9 current command or state

FLAGS 8 controller flags

ADDR 15 current disk address

WLK 16 write lock switches

TIME 24 interval between data transfers

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 non-existent disk

RAD data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS I/O
errors cannot occur. By default, the fixed head disk is assigned to
channel B as device 0.

## 723X Nine-Track Magnetic Tape (MT)

The magnetic tape controller supports up to eight units. MT options
include the ability to make units write enabled or write locked.

SET MTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET MTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

SET MTn CAPAC=m set unit n capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)

SHOW MTn CAPAC show unit n capacity in MB

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The magnetic tape controller
supports the BOOT command. BOOT MTn simulates the standard console fill
sequence for unit n.

The magnetic tape implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF\[0:65535\] 8 transfer buffer

BPTR 17 buffer pointer

BLNT 17 buffer length

RWINT 8 queued rewind interrupts

TIME 24 interval between character transfers

CTIME 24 channel response time

RWTIME 24 rewind time

UST\[0:7\] 8 drive status, drives 0 to 7

UCMD\[0:7\] 8 channel command, drives 0 to 7

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, drives 0 to 7

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready; if STOP\_IOE, stop

end of file end of tape

OS I/O error end of tape; if STOP\_IOE, stop

By default, the magnetic tape is assigned to channel A as device 0.

# Symbolic Display and Input

The Sigma 32b simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display
is controlled by command line switches:

\-a display as ASCII character (byte addressing)

\-b display as byte (byte addressing)

\-e display at EBCDIC character (byte addressing)

\-h display as halfword (halfword addressing)

\-ca display as four ASCII characters (word addressing)

\-ce display as four EBCDIC characters (word addressing)

\-m display instruction mnemonics (word addressing)

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

\# or -a ASCII character (byte addressing)

’ or –e EBCDIC character (byte addressing)

\-b hexadecimal byte (byte addressing)

\-h hexadecimal halfword (halfword addressing)

" or -ac four packed ASCII characters (word addressing)

\-ae four packed EBCDIC characters (word addressing)

alphabetic instruction mnemonic (word addressing)

numeric hexadecimal word (word addressing)

Instruction input uses (more or less) standard XDS Sigma assembler
syntax. All instructions are variants on the same basic form:

mnemonic{,reg} {\*{address{,index}}}

Mnemonics are symbolic names for instructions. Registers are decimal
values between 0 and 15. ‘\*’ represents indirect addressing. Addresses
are hexadecimal and can be signed if used as literals. Index registers
are always less than 8 and thus can be considered decimal.

Examples:

LW,5 \*100,7

AI,14 -3

LCFI A

WAIT

BCR,12 400

BNOV 10FE

SLS,6 -8

The extended branch and shift mnemonics are recognized and decoded
properly.
