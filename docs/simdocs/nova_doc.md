> 
> QTY 4060 multiplexer with up to 64 lines
> 
> ALM 4255 multiplexer with up to 64 lines

The Nova simulator implements these unique stop conditions:

  - Reference to undefined I/O device, and STOP\_DEV is set

  - More than INDMAX indirect addresses are detected during an interrupt

  - More than INDMAX indirect addresses are detected during memory
    reference address decoding

Note that indirect address loop detection does not exist on unmapped
Novas. Some DG diagnostics test thousands of levels of indirect
addressing. INDMAX may have to be set to 32,000 to get diagnostics to
run properly.

The LOAD command supports standard binary format tapes. The DUMP command
is not implemented.

All devices except TTI can be disabled or enabled, by the commands:

SET \<dev\> DISABLED

SET \<dev\> ENABLED

All devices except QTY are enabled by default.

## CPU

The only CPU options are the presence of the optional instructions and
the size of main memory.

SET CPU MDV enable multiply/divide

SET CPU EXT64KW enable extended 64KW memory mode

SET CPU NOVA3 set Nova3 CPU

SET CPU NOVA4 set Nova4 CPU

SET CPU KERONIX set Keronix CPU

SET CPU NONE disable all optional instructions

SET CPU 4K set memory size = 4K

SET CPU 8K set memory size = 8K

SET CPU 12K set memory size = 12K

SET CPU 16K set memory size = 16K

SET CPU 20K set memory size = 20K

SET CPU 24K set memory size = 24K

SET CPU 28K set memory size = 28K

SET CPU 32K set memory size = 32K

SET CPU 36K set memory size = 36K

SET CPU 40K set memory size = 40K

SET CPU 44K set memory size = 44K

SET CPU 48K set memory size = 48K

SET CPU 52K set memory size = 52K

SET CPU 56K set memory size = 56K

SET CPU 60K set memory size = 60K

SET CPU 64K set memory size = 64K

(MDV = unsigned multiply/divide instructions)

(Nova 3 = unsigned multiply/divide, stack, trap instructions)

(Nova 4 = unsigned and signed multiply/divide, stack, byte,

> trap instructions)

(Keronix = unsigned multiply/divide, extended 64KW mode)

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 32K.

The CPU supports the BOOT command. BOOT CPU simulates the Nova hardware
APL (automatic program load) feature. The switch register (SR) bits
12:17 must contain the device code of the device to be booted. If the
device is a "high-speed" (channel) device, SR bit 0 should also be set.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

WRU 8 interrupt character

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 65536 entries.

## Programmed I/O Devices

### Paper Tape Reader (PTR)

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 position in the input file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

end of file 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Terminal Input (TTI)

The terminal input polls the console keyboard for input. Terminal input
options include the ability to set ANSI mode or limited Dasher
compatibility mode:

SET TTI ANSI normal mode

SET TTI DASHER Dasher mode

Setting either TTI or TTO changes both devices. In Dasher mode, carriage
return is changed to newline on input, and ^X is changed to backspace.

The terminal input implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 number of characters input

TIME 24 keyboard polling interval

### Terminal Output (TTO)

The terminal output writes to the simulator console window. Terminal
output options include the ability to set ANSI mode or limited Dasher
compatibility mode:

SET TTI ANSI normal mode

SET TTI DASHER Dasher mode

Setting either TTI or TTO changes both devices. In Dasher mode, carriage
return is changed to newline on input, and ^X is changed to backspace.

The terminal output implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 number of characters output

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

### Line Printer (LPT)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The line printer implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Real-Time Clock (RTC)

The real-time clock (RTC) line frequency can be adjusted as follows:

SET RTC 60HZ set line frequency to 60Hz

SET RTC 50HZ set line frequency to 50Hz

The default is 60Hz.

The clock implements these registers:

name size comments

SELECT 2 selected clock interval

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

TIME0 24 clock frequency, select = 0

TIME1 24 clock frequency, select = 1

TIME2 24 clock frequency, select = 2

TIME3 24 clock frequency, select = 3

The real-time clock autocalibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

### Plotter (PLT)

The plotter (PLT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register specifies
the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by changing POS,
the user can backspace or advance the plotter.

The plotter implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Second Terminal (TTI1, TTO1)

The second terminal consists of two independent devices, TTI1 and TTO1.
The additional terminal performs input and output through a Telnet
session connecting into a user-specified port. The ATTACH command
specifies the port to be used:

ATTACH TTI1 \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Once TTI1 is attached and the simulator is running, the terminal listens
for a connection on the specified port. It assumes that the incoming
connection is a Telnet connection. The connection remains open until
disconnected by the Telnet client, or by a DETACH TTI1 command.

The second terminal has two options, recognized on both devices, for
setting limited Dasher-compatibility mode or ANSI mode:

SET TTI1 ANSI normal mode

SET TTI1 DASHER Dasher mode

SET TTO1 ANSI normal mode

SET TTO1 DASHER Dasher mode

Setting either TTI1 or TTO1 changes both devices. In Dasher mode,
carriage return is changed to newline on input, and ^X is changed to
backspace. TTO1 supports output logging. The SET TTO1 LOG command
enables logging:

SET TTO1 LOG=filename log output to filename

The SET TTO1 NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Other special TTI1 commands:

> SHOW TTI1 CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW TTI1 STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET TTO1 DISCONNECT disconnects the line.

The second terminal input implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

TIME 24 keyboard polling interval

The second terminal output implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 interrupt disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

### Asynchronous Multiplexers (QTY, ALM)

The QTY and ALM are terminal multiplexers with up to 64 lines. Either
the QTY or ALM can be enabled, but not both; the ALM is enabled by
default. The number of lines can be changed with the command

SET {QTY|ALM} LINES=n set line count to n

The line count maximum is 64.

The QTY and ALM support 8-bit input and output of characters. 8-bit I/O
may be incompatible with certain operating systems; 7-bit is the
default. The command

SET {QTY|ALM} 8B

enables 8-bit input and output.

The terminal lines perform input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command specifies the
port to be used:

ATTACH {-am} {QTY|ALM} \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. For the ALM multiplexer, the optional
switch -m turns on the multiplexer modem controls; the optional switch
-a turns on active disconnects (disconnect session if computer clears
Data Terminal Ready). The QTY multiplexer does not support modem
control. Without modem control, the multiplexer behaves as though
terminals were directly connected; disconnecting the Telnet session does
not cause any operating system-visible change in line status.

Once the multiplexer is attached and the simulator is running, it
listens for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the
incoming connections are Telnet connections. The connection remains open
until disconnected by the simulated program, the Telnet client, a SET
{QTY|ALM} DISCONNECT command, or a DETACH {QTY|ALM} command.

Other special QTY/ALM commands:

> SHOW {QTY|ALM} CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW {QTY|ALM} STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET {QTY|ALM} DISCONNECT=n disconnects the specified line.

The QTY/ALM implement these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 character buffer

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 device disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

MDMCTL 1 modem control flag

AUTODS 1 autodisconnect flag

POLLS 32 number of service polls

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

The multiplexers do not support save and restore. All open connections
are lost when the simulator shuts down or the multiplexer is detached.

## Fixed Head Disk (DSK)

Fixed head disk options include the ability to set the number of
platters to a fixed value between 1 and 8, or to autosize the number of
platters from the attached file:

SET DSK 1P one platter (256K)

SET DSK 2P two platters (512K)

SET DSK 3P three platters (768K)

SET DSK 4P four platters (1024K)

SET DSK 5P five platters (1280K)

SET DSK 6P six platters (1536K)

SET DSK 7P seven platters (1792K)

SET DSK 8P eight platters (2048K)

SET DSK AUTOSIZE autosized on ATTACH

The default is 1P (minimum size). The fixed head disk controller
supports the BOOT command.

The fixed head disk controller implements these registers:

name size comments

STAT 16 status

DA 16 disk address

MA 16 memory address

BUSY 1 device busy flag

DONE 1 device done flag

DISABLE 1 device disable flag

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

WLK 8 write lock switches

TIME 24 rotational delay, per sector

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

Fixed head disk data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of
file and OS I/O errors cannot occur.

## Moving Head Disk (DKP)

Moving head disk options include the ability to make units write enabled
or write locked, and to select the type of drive (or autosize):

SET DKPn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET DKPn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

SET DKPn FLOPPY (or 6030) set unit n to floppy disk

SET DKPn DSDD (or 6097) set unit n to double density floppy

SET DKPn D31 (or 4047) set unit n to Diablo 31

SET DKPn D44 (or 4234,6045) set unit n to Diablo 44

SET DKPn C111 (or 4048) set unit n to Century 111

SET DKPn C114 (or 2314,4057) set unit n to Century 114

SET DKPn 6225 set unit n to 6225

# Symbolic Display and Input

The Nova simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

\-a display as ASCII character

\-c display as two packed ASCII characters

\-m display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

' or -a ASCII character

" or -c two packed ASCII characters

alphabetic instruction mnemonic

numeric octal number

Instruction input uses standard Nova assembler syntax. There are three
instruction classes: memory reference, IOT, and operate.

Memory reference instructions have the format

memref {ac,}{@}address{,index}

LDA and STA require an initial register; ISZ, DSZ, JSR, and JMP do not.
The syntax for addresses and indices is as follows:

syntax mode displacement comments

0 \<= n \< 0400 0 n

{+/-}n \>= 0400 1 {+/-}n – PC must be in range \[-200, 177\]

invalid on disk

.+/-n 1 {+/-}n must be in range \[-200, 177\]

{+/-}n,2 2 {+/-}n must be in range \[-200, 177\]

{+/-}n,3 3 {+/-}n must be in range \[-200, 177\]

IOT instructions have one of four formats:

syntax example

iot HALT

iot reg INTA

iot device SKPDN

iot reg,device DOAS

Devices may be specified as mnemonics or as numbers in the range 0 -
077.

Operate instructions have the format:

opcode{\#} reg,reg{,skip}

In all Nova instructions, blanks may be substituted for commas as field
delimiters.
