Most devices can be disabled or enabled with the SET \<dev\> DISABLED
and SET \<dev\> ENABLED commands, respectively. The channel address of
all devices can be configured and must be enabled before being able to
use the device. SEL32 configurations must match valid UTX or MPX
configurations.

The LOAD and DUMP commands are not implemented.

Central Processor (CPU)
-----------------------

Central processor options include the CPU model, the CPU features, and
the size of main memory.

SET CPU 32/55 set CPU model to SEL 32/55

SET CPU 32/75 set CPU model to SEL 32/75

SET CPU 32/27 set CPU model to SEL 32/27

SET CPU 32/67 set CPU model to SEL 32/67

SET CPU 32/87 set CPU Model to SEL 32/87

SET CPU 32/97 set CPU model to SEL 32/97

SET CPU V6 set CPU model to SEL V6

SET CPU V9 set CPU model to SEL V9

SET CPU IDLE set idle mode

SET CPU NOIDLE set no idle mode

SET CPU 256K set memory size = 256KB

SET CPU 512K set memory size = 512KB

SET CPU 1M set memory size = 1024KB

SET CPU 2M set memory size = 2048KB

SET CPU 3M set memory size = 3072KB

SET CPU 4M set memory size = 4096KB

SET CPU 6M set memory size = 6144KB

SET CPU 8M set memory size = 8192KB

SET CPU 12M set memory size = 12288KB

SET CPU 16M set memory size = 16384KB

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial configuration is SEL 32/27
CPU with 2MB of memory. IOP at channel 0x7E00, Console at 0x7EFC, tape
at 0x1000, and disk at 0x0800. Interval Timer at 0x7f04 and Real-Time
Clock at 0x7f06.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history buffer is 10,000 entries before
wrapping around..

Memory Mapping
--------------

Through the late 1970's to the early 1990's SEL computers used a variety
of memory mapping schemes. The 32/55 was the first PC board SEL
computer. Previous computers (8500/8600) had wire-wrapped backplanes to
interconnect components. The 32/55 had no memory mapping and had a .5 mb
address space. The 32/75 was the first mapped machine and had a 1 mb
address space. The 32/27 & 32/87 expanded the address space to 2 mb. The
32/67 & 32/97 had a 16 mb address space and finally the V6 & V9 added
virtual memory to the system. The CPU maintains a cache of the current
values in the map registers. Depending on the CPU type, an address space
is constructed using the current map cache. Addresses are translated if
the CPU is operating in the mapped mode. The V6 and V9 CPUs also have
demand paging traps that allow a virtual address space. The TLB
(Translation Lookaside Buffer) is used to lookup pages (maps) that are
in memory and if not resident, execute a page request trap to the O/S.
The memory map implements two types of protection when in the
unprivileged mode: quarter page write protection and page
read/write/execute access protection on virtual addresses. Following is
a summary of the mapping/protection for each CPU type:

name maps size task size comments

32/55 0 0 512mb No mapping

32/77 32 32kb 1024mb 8kb r/w protection

32/27 256 8kb 2048mb 8kb r/w protection

32/87 256 8kb 2048mb 8kb r/w protection

32/67 2048 8kb 16384mb 8kb r/w protection

32/97 2048 8kb 16384mb 8kb r/w protection

V6 2048 8kb 16384mb 32mb r/w/x protection

V9 2048 8kb 16384mb 32mb r/w/x protection

Interrupt System (INT)
----------------------

The SEL32 implements a multi-level priority interrupt system, with a
maximum of 112 interrupt levels. It also maintains interrupt status and
settings in the 256 word SPAD memory maintained by the CPU and O/S
software. The examine command can be used to display the contents of the
INT and SPAD registers.

examine INT\[\[all\] display all INT data.

examine INT\[6\] display interrupt level 6 status.

examine SPAD\[all\] display all SPAD data.

examine SPAD\[24\] display word twenty-four of the SPAD.

IOP/MFP
-------

The IOP or MFP is an integrated controller controller that allows
multiple controllers to be configured. At least one IOP or MFP must be
defined for a system and have a RTC/ITM defined and a console TTY.
Optional LPR and 8-Line devices can be controlled. The MFP can also
control two SCSI disk/tape controllers.

The MPF/IOP must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

SET MFP enabled enable MFP or

SET IOP enabled enable IOP

IOP Console (CON)
-----------------

The console terminal (CON) consists of two units. Unit 0 is for console
input, unit 1 for console output. The console shares the IOP channel
controller and interrupt.

The console attention sequence (@\@A) is supported via the attention
trap at (0xB4). The trap code assigned to this trap level will determine
the action that will take place. In MPX, this is usually the operator
communications task.

The console must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

SET CON enabled enable console I/O

By default, the console terminal is assigned to channel 0x7EFC (input)
and 0x7EFD (output) . An IOP console must be defined for the simulator
to operate.

IOP Line Printer (LPR)
----------------------

The line printer is attached to the IOP at address 0x7EF8 and shares the
IOP channel controller and interrupt. The line printer (LPR) writes data
to a disk file that is attached to the LPR device. The number of lines
per page and the device address can be set.

The line printer can be assigned to a file using the following command:

ATTACH LPR LPOUTPUT set output to file lpoutput

The lines per page can be assigned using the following command:

SET LPR LINESPERPAGE=60 set lines per page to 60

The LPR device address can be assigned using the following command:

SET LPR DEV=7EF8 set device address to 7EF8.

The LPR must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

SET LPR enabled enable line printer

By default, the line printer is assigned to channel LP7EF8 with 66 lines
per page.

IOP Interval Timer (ITM)
------------------------

The SEL32 computer implements an interval timer that can be loaded with
a down count. When the count reaches zero, the CPU will be interrupted.
The timer can optionally be set to continue down counting or reload a
preset values. The clock is started, stopped, read, and written by the
software. The count frequency can be set to 38.4us or 76.8us per clock
increment. To set the frequency:

SET ITM 3840 set count interval to 38.4us.

SET ITM 7680 set count interval to 76.8us.

The current setting can be displayed by:

SHO ITM

The ITM must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

SET ITM enabled enable interval timer

The default address of the interval timer is 0x7F04. The default
interrupt level is 0x5f (95).

Real-Time Clock (RTC)
---------------------

The SEL32 computer implements a real-time clock. It can be set to a
variety of frequencies, 50Hz, 60Hz, 100Hz, and 120hz. The frequency of
the clock can be adjusted as follows:

SET RTC freq set clock to specified frequency

The frequency of the clock can be display as follows:

SHOW RTC show current clock frequency

The RTC must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

SET RTC enabled enable clock

The real-time clock auto-calibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up
or down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time. The default
address is 0x7F06. The default interrupt level is 0x18 (24).

IOP 8-Line Asynchronous Controller (COM)
----------------------------------------

The character-oriented communications subsystem implements 8
asynchronous interfaces per controller, with modem control. The
subsystem has two controllers: COMC for the scanner and COML for the
individual lines. The terminal multiplexer performs input and output
through Telnet sessions connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH
command specifies the port to be used:

ATTACH COMC \<port\> set up telnet listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. Non-root users will require the port
to be 1024-65536,

The COMC operates in ASCII. Each line (each unit of COML) supports four
character processing modes: UC, 7P, 7B, and 8B.

mode input characters output characters

UC high-order bit cleared, high-order bit cleared,

lower case converted lower case converted

to upper case to upper case

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The COMC controller must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

SET COM enabled enable communications controller

The serial lines can be individually enabled/disabled and must be
enabled to be active. Set active by:

SET COMLn enabled enable serial line

The default is UC. In addition, each line supports output logging. The
SET CONLn LOG command enables logging on a line:

SET COMLn filename log output of line n to filename

The SET COMLn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once COMC is attached and enabled and the simulator is running, the
multiplexer listens for connections

on the specified port. It assumes that the incoming connections are
Telnet connections. The connections remain open until disconnected by
the Telnet client, a SET COMC DISCONNECT command, or a DETACH COMC
command.

Other special multiplexer commands:

> SHOW COMC CONNECTIONS show current connections
>
> SHOW COMC STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
>
> SET COMLn DISCONNECT disconnects the specified line.

The terminal multiplexer does not support save and restore. All open
connections are lost when the simulator shuts down or COMC is detached.
By default, the multiplexer is assigned to IOP channel 0x7e00 at devices
0x7EC0-0x7EC8.

 2311/2314 UDP Disk Processors (DMA, DMB)
----------------------------------------

SET MTA enabled enable MTA SCSI disk

SET MTB enabled enable MTB SCSI disk

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The magnetic tape controller
supports the BOOT command. BOOT MTn simulates the standard console fill
sequence for unit n.

By default, the magnetic tape is assigned to channel 0x1000 but can be
changed with the SET MTA0 DEV=1800 command.

2.15 8516 Ethernet Controller {#ethernet-controller .list-paragraph}
-----------------------------

The Ethernet controller allows the user to connect to the internet. The
SetupNet script in the tests directory allows the network device to be
created on the host system. A MAC address may defined or a default one
can be used. The Ethernet device can be connected to the local network
using the following directive:

AT EC TAP:TAP0 attach to tap port on host

The transmission mode (0-2) can be set using the following directive:

SET EC MODE=n set mode to 0, 1, or 2

The MAC address can be set with the following directive:

SET EC MAC=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX set MAC address

The Ethernet controller must be enabled for it to be active. Set active
by:

SET EC enabled enable Ethernet controller

By default, the Ethernet controller is assigned to channel 0x0e00 but
can be changed with the

SET EC DEV=0e00 command. For UTX the MODE needs to be set to MODE=2 and
the SET EC MAC = command should not be used.

Symbolic Display
================

The SEL-32 simulator implements symbolic display and input when using
the EXAMINE command. Display is controlled by command line switches:

-a display as ASCII character (byte addressing)

-b display as byte (byte addressing)

-o display as octal value

-d display as decimal

-h display as hexadecimal

-m display base register instruction mnemonics

-n display non-base register instruction mnemonics

Diagnostics for SEL-32 Simulator
================================

The operation of the SEL-32 simulator can be verified using the standard
SEL diagnostic suite. It is provided in the tests directory. The command
file sel32\_test.ini is run after compilation of the simulator by the
makefile. It uses the diagnostic tape file diag.tap. On the tape is
another diagnostic command file that runs each of the diagnostics
automatically. The default CPU is the 32/27. The file diag.ini is a file
that can be edited to start different simulator configurations and test
them using the diag.tap file as input.

Run the diagnostic by inputting: ./sel32 diag.ini at the Linux or
Windows command prompt. Output will be to the user terminal and also the
sel.log file.
