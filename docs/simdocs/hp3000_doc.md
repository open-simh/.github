# Introduction

This manual documents the features and operation of the HP 3000
simulator. It is intended for use in conjunction with the *SIMH Users\'
Guide* manual, which describes how to compile and run the simulator, as
well as the general commands that may be entered at the Simulation
Control Program (SCP) prompt.

## The HP 3000 Computer System

Hewlett-Packard sold the HP 3000 family of general-purpose business
computers from 1972 through 2001. There are two major divisions within
this family: the *classic* 16-bit, stack-oriented CISC machines, and the
*Precision Architecture* 32-bit, register-oriented RISC machines that
succeeded them. All machines run versions of MPE, the *Multiprogramming
Executive* operating system.

Within the classic division, there are two additional subdivisions,
based on the method used for peripheral connections: the original *SIO*
machines, and the later *HP-IB* machines. The I/O interfacing hardware
differs between the two types of machines, as do the privileged I/O
machine instructions. The user instruction sets are identical, as are
the register sets visible to the programmer. The I/O drivers are
different to account for the hardware differences, and therefore they
run slightly different versions of MPE.

This implementation is a simulator for the classic SIO machines. This
group consists of the 3000 CX, the Series I, Series II, and the HP 3000
Series III that is simulated here. The CX and the Series I, which is a
repackaged CX, are essentially subsets of the Series II/III --- a
smaller instruction set, limited memory size, and lower-precision
floating-point instructions. Simulation of these machines may be added
in the future. Future simulation of the HP-IB machines (the Series 30
through 70) is desirable, as the latest MPE versions run only on these
machines, but documentation on the internals of the HP-IB hardware
controllers is nonexistent.

The CX and Series I support 64K 16-bit words of memory. The Series II
supports up to 256K, divided into four banks of 64K words each, and the
Series III extends this to 1024K words using 16 banks. Memory is divided
into variable-length code and data segments, with the latter containing
a program's global data area and stack.

Memory protection is accomplished by checking program, data, and stack
accesses against segment base and limit registers, which can be set only
by MPE. Bounds violations cause automatic hardware traps to handler
routines within MPE. Some violations may be permitted; for example, a
Stack Overflow trap may cause MPE to allocate a larger stack and then
restart the interrupted instruction. Memory references are
position-independent, so moving segments to accommodate expansion
requires only resetting of the segment registers to point at the new
locations. Code segments are fully reentrant and shareable, and both
code and data are virtual, as the hardware supports absent code and data
segment traps.

The classic 3000s are stack machines. Most of the instructions operate
on the value on the top of the stack (TOS) or on the TOS and the
next-to-the-top of the stack (NOS). To improve execution speed, the 3000
has a set of hardware registers that are accessed as the first four
locations at the top of the stack, while the remainder of the stack
locations reside in main memory. A hardware register renamer provides
fast stack pushes and pops without physically copying values between
registers.

## Simulator Files

The simulator sources are divided into a set of files for the Simulator
Control Program and its support libraries, and a set of files for the HP
3000 device simulations; the latter reside in a subdirectory of the
directory that contains the SCP files. The former set is common to all
SIMH simulators, whereas the latter set is specific to the virtual
machine being simulated. The files that make up this simulator are:

# Simulator Features

The HP 3000 simulator contains the following device simulations:

|***Device Name***  | ***Simulates***|
|-------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**CPU**            | 30003B Series III Computer with up to 1024 KW of memory|
|**IOP**            | 30003B I/O Processor|
|**SEL**            | 30030C Selector Channel|
|**ATCD**           | 30032B Asynchronous Terminal Controller data interface|
|**ATCC**           | 30032B Asynchronous Terminal Controller control interface|
|**SCMB1, SCMB2**   | 30033A Selector Channel Maintenance Boards|
|**MPX**            | 30036B Multiplexer Channel|
|**CLK**            | 30135A System Clock|
|**LP**             | 30209A Line Printer Controller with one 2607/13/17/18 line printer|
|**MS**             | 30215A Magnetic Tape Controller with four 7970B/E drives|
|**DS**             | 30229B Disc Interface with eight 7905/7906/7920/7925 drives|

One instance of each listed device may be installed in the simulated
computer chassis. Some devices support multiple connected units. As an
example, the DS device simulates a single 30229B Disc Interface that
connects up to eight drives. However, a second 30229B connecting an
additional eight drives is not supported.

The simulator has been tested with and supports the following operating
systems:

-   MPE V/R version E.01.00.

In addition, the simulator generally passes the HP 32230 Stand-Alone
Diagnostics suite; see *hp3000\_diag.txt* for details.

The simulator may be configured to stop for any of these conditions:

-   Attempted execution of an instruction that enters an infinite loop
    (e.g., BR P+0).

-   Attempted execution of a PAUS instruction.

-   Attempted execution of an undefined instruction.

-   Attempted execution of an unimplemented instruction.

MPE normally handles these conditions internally. However, when running
diagnostics, it may be helpful to set one or more of these stop
conditions. In particular, some diagnostics execute a PAUS instruction
to wait for operator action, rather than external interrupts, or branch
in an infinite loop to indicate an error condition. Unless the
corresponding simulator stops are active, no indications of these
conditions will be observed.

The simulator also provides extensive facilities for tracing CPU and I/O
device operations.

## Hardware-Equivalent Actions

The current implementation does not provide simulations of the CPU or
peripheral device front panels. Instead, commands entered through the
simulation console are used to perform hardware actions. The simulation
commands that substitute for CPU front-panel actions are:

|***Hardware Front-Panel Action***            | ***Equivalent Simulation Command***|
|---------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------|
|Pressing the RUN/HALT button while halted    | RUN|
|Pressing the RUN/HALT button while running   | CTRL+E|
|Pressing the LOAD and ENABLE buttons         | LOAD|
|Pressing the DUMP and ENABLE buttons         | DUMP|
|Toggling the CPU RESET switch                | RESET|
|Setting the PF/ARS switch to ENABLE          | SET CPU ARS|
|Setting the PF/ARS switch to DISABLE         | SET CPU NOARS|
|Displaying the Current Instruction Register  | EXAMINE CIR|
|Displaying the System Switch Register        | EXAMINE SWCH|
|Setting the System Switch Register           | DEPOSIT SWCH \<value\>|

Mounting media on a peripheral device is simulated by the ***ATTACH***
command. For example, entering the ***ATTACH LP
\<printer-image-filename\>*** command is equivalent to loading paper
into an HP 2617A Line Printer. Inserting a disc pack into an HP 7905A
disc drive set for unit 2 is simulated by the ***ATTACH DS2
\<disc-image-filename\>*** command.

Each of these commands is explained in more detail below.

In hardware, loading programs into memory from a device is accomplished
by setting the System Switch Register to the desired control and device
number and pressing the LOAD and ENABLE buttons together to initiate the
cold load sequence. In simulation, a cold load may be performed either
explicitly or implicitly. Explicit operation is described in the LOAD,
DUMP, and BOOT section below. As a convenience, ***BOOT \<device\>***
commands may be used to implicitly cold load their respective devices
and are described in the individual device descriptions below.

## Simulator-Specific Commands

In general, all of the commands documented in the *SIMH Users\' Guide*
manual are available for use with the HP 3000 simulator. Commands whose
execution or parameters are implementation-defined are specified below.

### Numeric Display and Entry

When examining or depositing into memory, the radix for addresses is
octal, and the default radix for numeric data is octal. The data default
may be changed with the ***SET CPU { BIN \| OCT \| DEC \| HEX }***
command, or the radix may be overridden temporarily with a command line
switch, as follows:

|***Switch***         | ***Interpretation***|
|---------------------| ---------------------|
|**--2**              | A binary value|
|**--8** or **--O**   | An octal value|
|**--10** or **--D**  | A decimal value|
|**--16** or **--H**  | A hexadecimal value|

When examining or depositing into device registers, the default radix
for the specified register is used unless overridden with one of the
above command line switches. Defaults are listed in the register table
associated with each device.

### Symbolic Display and Entry

When examining or depositing into memory or certain registers, command
line switches specifying the symbolic mode and format may be used to
override the default numeric mode, as follows:

|***Switch***  | ***Mode Interpretation***|
|--------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**--A**       | A single character in the right-hand byte|
|**--C**       | A two-character packed string|
|**--E**       | An EDIT subprogram operation mnemonic|
|**--ER**      | An EDIT subprogram operation mnemonic starting with the right-hand byte|
|**--I**       | An I/O program instruction mnemonic|
|**--M**       | A CPU instruction mnemonic|
|**--T**       | A CPU status mnemonic|

In the absence of a mode switch or a specified symbolic default,
entering values with a leading \' (apostrophe) implies ***--A***, and a
leading \" (quotation mark) implies ***--C***. The specific registers
supporting symbolic mode are indicated in their respective device
sections below.

If the ***--C*** switch is specified, the value is displayed as two
characters separated by a comma. Alphanumeric, punctuation, and symbol
characters are displayed within apostrophes, control characters are
displayed as ASCII name abbreviations, and characters above 128 decimal
are displayed in escaped numeric form with a leading backslash followed
by an octal number. Depositing with ***--C*** accepts two displayable
characters. If a single character is supplied, the low byte of the
resulting value will be zero; follow the character with a space to pad
the low byte with a blank.

If the ***--M*** switch is specified, the value is displayed as a CPU
machine instruction mnemonic if it is defined. If it is not, it is
displayed as a numeric value in the CPU\'s data radix. Any numeric
operands present are displayed in a default radix unless overridden by
the addition of one of these mutually exclusive format switches:

|***Switch***  | ***Format Interpretation***|
|--------------| ------------------------------------------|
|**--A**       | A single character in the right-hand byte|
|**--B**       | A binary value|
|**--O**       | An octal value|
|**--D**       | A decimal value|
|**--H**       | A hexadecimal value|

Numeric operands are displayed in a radix suitable to the type of the
value. For CPU instruction operands:

-   Register-relative displacements, S-register decrements, and K fields
    are displayed in the CPU's address radix, which is octal.

-   Shift counts, bit positions, and starting bits and counts are
    displayed in decimal unless overridden by a switch on the command
    line.

-   CIR values for the PAUS and HALT instructions are displayed in octal
    unless overridden by a switch on the command line.

-   Immediate values are displayed in the CPU\'s data radix, which
    defaults to octal but may be set to a different radix or
    overridden by a switch on the command line.

For I/O program instruction operands:

-   Address values are displayed in the CPU's address radix, which is
    octal.

-   Counts are displayed in decimal unless overridden by a switch on the
    command line.

-   Control and status values are displayed in the CPU\'s data radix,
    which defaults to octal but may be set to a different radix or
    overridden by a switch on the command line.

For CPU status values:

-   The current code segment number is displayed in the CPU's data
    radix, which defaults to octal but may be set to a different radix
    or overridden by a switch on the command line.

For EDIT subprogram operands:

-   Branch displacement fields are displayed in the CPU's address radix,
    which is octal.

-   Character counts, loop counts, and source and target adjustments are
    displayed in decimal unless overridden by a switch on the command
    line.

-   Invalid operation codes are displayed in the CPU\'s data radix,
    which defaults to octal but may be set to a different radix or
     overridden by a switch on the command line.

Each EDIT subprogram operation occupies from 1 to 257 bytes in memory.
If a multi-byte operation begins within the examined memory range, the
additional bytes required to complete the operation are displayed.
Including the ***--R*** switch will begin decoding with the right-hand
(low-order) byte of the first memory word in the range rather than with
the left-hand byte. Invalid extended operation codes are displayed as a
comma-separated pair of half-byte values (e.g., "17,12").

If the indicated display radix is not the same as the current CPU data
radix, a leading character ***@***, ***%***, ***\#***, or ***!***, is
printed for binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal numbers,
respectively.

When the simulator examines the bit patterns of instructions in memory
or registers to display in mnemonic form, each will fall into one of
four categories:

1.  Defined (canonical) instruction encodings, where all bits are
    defined or all reserved bits are zero (e.g., LOAD).

2.  Undefined (non-canonical) instruction encodings, where reserved
    fields are "don\'t care" bits (e.g., MOVE).

3.  Undefined (non-canonical) instruction encodings, where reserved
    fields are decoded (e.g., IXIT).

4.  Unimplemented instruction encodings (e.g., stack opcode 072, or EADD
    ithout the EIS firmware option installed).

The names of the canonical instructions in category 1 are displayed in
uppercase, as are the names of the non-canonical instructions in
category 2. The non-canonical instruction names in category 3 are
displayed in lowercase. This is to indicate to the user that the
instructions that will be executed may not be the ones expected from the
decoding. Instruction names in category 4 that correspond to supported
firmware options are displayed in uppercase, regardless of whether or
not the option is enabled. Category 4 encodings that do not correspond
to instructions are displayed in octal.

### Memory Addressing

The CPU simulator supports two forms of memory addresses:

-   An absolute address consisting of a 4-bit bank number and a 16-bit
    offset within the bank, separated by a period (e.g.,
    ***17.177777***).

-   A relative address consisting of a 16-bit offset within a bank
    specified by a bank register (e.g., ***177777***).

Command line switches modify the interpretation of relative addresses as
follows:

|***Switch***  | ***Interpretation***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------------|
|**--P**       | The implied bank number is obtained from PBANK|
|**--S**       | The implied bank number is obtained from SBANK|

If no switch is specified, the implied bank number is obtained from
DBANK.

#### EXAMINE, DEPOSIT, IEXAMINE, and IDEPOSIT

The following address forms are valid:

    EXAMINE <bank>.<offset>
    EXAMINE <dbank-offset>
    EXAMINE -P <pbank-offset>
    EXAMINE -S <sbank-offset>

Addresses are always displayed in *\<bank\>.\<offset\>* form.

#### BREAK and NOBREAK

The following address forms are valid:

    BREAK
    BREAK <bank>.<offset>
    BREAK <pbank-offset>

The address defaults to the current values of PBANK and/or P. All
breakpoint addresses are stored and displayed in *\<bank\>.\<offset\>*
form.

#### RUN and GO

The following address form is valid:

    RUN <pbank-offset>

The offset is stored in P. If P does not lie within the PB-to-PL range,
the command will be rejected.

The SIMH ***RUN*** command typically resets all devices before beginning
execution. For the HP 3000, CPU and I/O resets are performed at the
start of the cold load sequence; a reset after the cold load sequence
completes will destroy the Interrupt Control Stack register setup
performed by the microcode. Therefore, in this simulator, the ***RUN***
and ***GO*** commands are equivalent; neither resets the devices. If an
explicit CPU reset is desired, the ***RESET CPU*** command may be used.

### LOAD, DUMP, and BOOT

The ***LOAD*** command implements the 3000 cold load facility. It is
equivalent to pressing the LOAD and ENABLE buttons on the hardware front
panel. The syntax is:

    LOAD {<control/devno>}

The SWCH register controls the cold load sequence; the upper byte
contains a device-specific control value, and the lower byte contains
the device number. If the optional control/device number value is
supplied, it is deposited into the SWCH register before initiating the
cold load sequence. Otherwise, the SWCH register value must be set
before entering the command. In either case, the device number must be
between 3 and 63, or the command will not complete.

The ***DUMP*** command implements the 3000 cold dump facility. It is
equivalent to pressing the DUMP and ENABLE buttons on the hardware front
panel. The syntax is:

    DUMP {<control/devno>}

The CPU ***DUMPCTL*** and ***DUMPDEV*** settings control the cold dump
sequence and correspond to the settings of the jumper blocks on the rear
of the CPU front panel. If the optional control/device number value is
supplied, it is deposited into the SWCH register before initiating the
cold dump sequence. Otherwise, the ***DUMPCTL*** and ***DUMPDEV***
values are deposited into the SWCH register. A successful cold dump sets
the CIR register to the number of 64K memory banks dumped. For example,
dumping a 512K-word system will display Cold dump complete, CIR: 000010
if the operation succeeds.

The control/device number values are entered in the current CPU data
radix. Before entering either command, unit 0 of the associated device
must be attached. A failed cold load will cause a system halt. A failed
cold dump will set the CIR register to the memory bank number at which
the operation failed; if the dump device is not ready or not
write-enabled, the CIR register will be set to zero.

Bootable peripherals, such as the tape and disc drives, also implement
the ***BOOT*** command. Entering a ***BOOT*** command for one of these
devices will preset the SWCH register to the appropriate value before
executing a cold load. Cold load supports booting only from unit 0 of
the target device.

### POWER FAIL and POWER RESTORE

The ***POWER FAIL*** command (and its alternate forms ***POWER OFF***
and ***POWER DOWN***) simulates removing AC power from the system. If
the CPU was executing when the command is entered, a power-fail
interrupt is generated, and MPE initiates its power-fail processing that
ends with a programmed HALT. Otherwise, power is removed, and the CPU
remains halted. ***POWER FAIL*** is accepted only when power is on.

The ***POWER RESTORE*** command (and its alternate forms ***POWER ON***
and ***POWER UP***) simulates restoring AC power to the system; it is
accepted only when power is off. If the CPU was executing when power
failed, a power-on trap is generated, and, if auto-restart is enabled,
MPE initiates its power-recovery processing. If auto-restart is
disabled, the trap is set up but the simulator must be resumed with a
***CONTINUE*** command to execute the trap. If the CPU was halted when
power failed, power is restored, and the CPU remains halted. Once power
is off, the ***CONTINUE***, ***STEP***, ***GO***, and ***RUN*** commands
will not be accepted until power is restored.

### Device Configuration

Most devices support user configuration. The general forms of the
configuration commands are:

    SET {<switch> ...} <device> <option> {,<option> ...}
    SET {<switch> ...} <unit> <option> {,<option> ...}

The options available and applicable switches are described in the
individual device descriptions below.

### Enabling and Disabling Devices

All devices other than the processor devices may be disabled or enabled.
Disabling a device simulates removing the associated interface from the
system cabinet. To disable or enable a device, use:

|***Command***                | ***Action***|
|-----------------------------| -------------------|
|**SET \<device\> DISABLED**  | Disable the device|
|**SET \<device\> ENABLED**   | Enable the device|

Devices that consist of multiple addressable units connected to a
controller allow the units to be individually disabled or enabled.
Disabling simulates disconnecting the associated unit from the
controller. The commands to disable or enable a unit are:

|***Command***              | ***Action***|
|---------------------------| -----------------|
|**SET \<unit\> DISABLED**  | Disable the unit|
|**SET \<unit\> ENABLED**   | Enable the unit|

Each of the above command options is replicated in the option tables of
the devices to which they apply.

### I/O Interface Assignments

HP 3000 hardware I/O interfaces have configuration jumpers that set
device numbers, interrupt masks, and Multiplexer Channel service request
priority numbers. In addition, the interrupt poll order, and therefore
the interrupt priority, is established by the position of each interface
along the daisy-chained interrupt cable.

Device options that may be specified to change or display interface
configurations are:

|***Option***  | ***Valid Values*** |  ***Action***|
|--------------| -------------------|--------------------------------|
|**DEVNO**     | 0-127              |  Set the device number|
|**INTMASK**   | 0-15, D, E         |  Set the interrupt mask|
|**INTPRI**    | 0-31               |  Set the interrupt priority|
|**SRNO**      | 0-15               |  Set the service request number|

For example:

    SET MS DEVNO=6
    SET MS INTMASK=E
    SHOW MS DEVNO,INTMASK

The interrupt mask may be set to a numeric value, to ***D*** to disable
the mask always, or to ***E*** to enable the mask always. Numeric mask
values may be shared among devices. However, if two device, interrupt
priority, or service request priority numbers conflict, the simulator
will report the error when execution is attempted.

The default settings are:

|***Device Name***  | ***Device Number*** |  ***Interrupt Priority***| ***Interrupt Mask*** |   ***Service Request Number*|
|-------------------| --------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
|**CPU**            | --                  |  --                      |   --                 |    --|
|**IOP**            | --                  |  --                      |   --                 |    --|
|**SEL**            | --                  |  --                      |   --                 |    --|
|**MPX**            | 127                 |  --                      |   --                 |    --|
|**ATCD**           | 7                   |  0                       |   E                  |    --|
|**ATCC**           | 8                   |  8                       |   E                  |    --|
|**CLK**            | 3                   |  1                       |   --                 |    --|
|**DS**             | 4                   |  4                       |   E                  |    --|
|**LP**             | 14                  |  18                      |   E                  |    11|
|**MS**             | 6                   |  14                      |   E                  |    3|
|**SCMB1**          | 65                  |  10                      |   --                 |    0|
|**SCMB2**          | 66                  |  11                      |   --                 |    1|

The SCMB device numbers and interrupt priorities may be set to any
unused values.

### SAVE and RESTORE

***SAVE*** and ***RESTORE*** are supported only when the simulator
executable used to restore the simulator state file is the same
simulator executable used to save the file. Correctly restoring the
state of the simulator depends on the layout of internal structure
variables being identical to the layout of the structure variables that
were saved. This is guaranteed only when using the same executable, as
the layout used is implementation-defined.

## Realistic, Calibrated, and Optimized Timing

Devices simulate their I/O operation delays (disc seeks, magnetic tape
reads, printer paper movements, etc.) by counting specified numbers of
"event ticks." For example, a disc seek completion might be scheduled to
occur 500 event ticks after command initiation. Generally, one event
tick is counted for each machine instruction executed, although some
complex instructions may count an event tick for each internal step of
the instruction (e.g., for each word moved within a block-move
instruction). Device simulations provide commands that determine how the
appropriate tick counts are selected for I/O operations timing:

|***Command***                  | ***Action***|
|-------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------|
|***SET \<device\> REALTIME***  | Configure the device to use realistic timing|
|***SET \<device\> CALTIME***   | Configure the device to use calibrated timing|
|***SET \<device\> FASTTIME***  | Configure the device to use optimized timing|

A device configured to use *realistic timing* selects its tick counts to
encompass the same number of machine instructions as would be executed
in hardware. In real-time mode, an operation taking ten milliseconds in
hardware will complete after 4000 machine instructions are executed,
based on an average instruction execution time of 2.5 microseconds. In
this mode, a software program will execute approximately the same number
of instructions during a device operation that it would do on a real
machine. Host machine speed and execution of concurrent host programs
will not affect the number of simulated instructions executed for a
given operation.

A device configured to use *calibrated timing* selects its tick counts
to align the simulated operation periods with the corresponding time
periods on the host system. In calibrated-time mode, an operation taking
ten milliseconds in hardware will complete after ten milliseconds has
elapsed on the host system. Because the simulator is generally one or
two orders of magnitude faster than the hardware, a software program
will execute far more code during a device operation than it would do on
a real machine. In this mode, the amount of code that executes will vary
with the speed of the host machine and the load placed on that machine
by other concurrent processes, as the simulator continually adjusts the
tick counts up and down to maintain synchronization with the host time.

A device configured to use *optimized timing* selects its tick counts to
minimize the operation delays. In fast-time mode, an operation taking
ten milliseconds in hardware will complete after the minimum amount of
time acceptable to the executing software has elapsed. In this mode,
device operations complete far more quickly than they do in hardware.
There are limits, however, to how fast I/O operations may occur without
causing software malfunctions. In practice, system software often
contains assumptions regarding the time certain operations take, so
event timing may not be arbitrarily reduced. For instance, an I/O driver
may "know" that a line printer takes 50 milliseconds to print a line,
and therefore it can ignore interrupts safely for several milliseconds
after initiating the print cycle. If the printing time is reduced below
that threshold, the driver may fail to operate correctly. The default
optimized-timing settings have been empirically determined to work with
the supported operating systems listed above, and each device simulator
allows the user to modify those settings via registers if needed.

To illustrate how the modes affect timing, consider a simulation of a
Teletype terminal that operates at 10 characters per second. If the
simulator runs 15 times faster than a real machine, then a user would
observe that printing 100 characters takes:

-   10 seconds in CALTIME mode\
    (100 characters × *n* event ticks per character adjusted to take
    exactly 100 mS each on the host system)

-   667 milliseconds in REALTIME mode\
    (100 characters × 40,000 event ticks per character × 2.5 µS per
    tick ÷ 15 times hardware speed)

-   8.33 milliseconds in FASTTIME mode\
    (100 characters × 500 event ticks per character × 2.5 µS per tick
    ÷ 15 times hardware speed)

If the SCP ***SET THROTTLE*** command is used to reduce the speed of the
simulator, CALTIME operations will not be affected, but REALTIME and
FASTTIME operations will slow proportionally. Reducing simulator speed
to that of the original hardware will cause REALTIME operation times to
equal CALTIME times.

Devices offer only those modes that are generally useful. For example,
the CPU process clock and system clock may be configured to use REALTIME
or CALTIME modes. The real-time mode will satisfy the expectations of
hardware diagnostics that check the timing of operations via delay
loops, whereas the calibrated mode will update the MPE time-of-day clock
as expected by users of the simulated system. FASTTIME mode is not
offered, as it makes no sense to ignore the programmed time period
settings and use a fixed arbitrary period instead.

Devices performing input or output typically offer a REALTIME mode for
use when running the diagnostics and a FASTTIME mode for use when
running operating systems. In general, software running under simulation
will run faster when devices are configured for optimized-time mode, and
this is the default for all peripheral devices.

## The Simulation Console and the System Console

When the simulator is started, the SCP command prompt appears at the
*simulation console.* For windowed host operating systems, this is
typically the same window from which the simulator was started. Once a
***RUN*** command is entered at the simulation console, the standalone
diagnostics and MPE operating system begin their user interactions at
the *system console*. The HP 3000 reserves channel 0 of the ATC terminal
multiplexer for the system console.

For convenience and by default, the system console is connected to the
simulation console, so that SCP and MPE operator commands may be entered
from the same window. Additional "user" terminals may be connected via
Telnet or serial ports to ATC channels 1-15 as described later.

The system console may be separated from the simulation console by using
the ***SET CONSOLE TELNET=\<port\>*** or ***SET CONSOLE
SERIAL=\<port\>*** command. This leaves the simulation console at the
initiating window and moves the system console to a Telnet or serial
port, allowing the use of an HP terminal or terminal emulator. Entering
the ***SET CONSOLE NOTELNET*** or ***SET CONSOLE NOSERIAL*** command
will rejoin the consoles

## Tracing Simulator Operations

The simulator provides options for extensive tracing of the internal
operations of all devices. This is useful as an aid to hardware and
software debugging as well as to gain an understanding of the internal
operations of the simulated devices. Each device offers multiple trace
reporting levels, from command overviews to detailed backplane signal
assertions. Tracing for each device and its separate reporting levels
may be enabled independently.

To obtain a trace, two SCP commands must be given. First, a *debug log*
must be established with the ***SET DEBUG \<target\>*** command. This
command is described in detail in the "Controlling Debugging" section of
the *SIMH Users\' Guide* manual. Typically, the target is a text file,
so that the trace may be reviewed after capture. Second, tracing must be
enabled for the desired devices with ***SET \<device\>
DEBUG=\<option\>*** commands. These are documented below in the sections
that refer to the simulated devices.

The reporting level options table given for each device is arranged in
order of increasing detail. The first option listed provides the
broadest overview with the least specific detail and generates the
smallest number of trace lines, thereby slowing program execution the
least. Subsequent options provide increasing detail at the expense of
larger debug log files. Enabling all trace options with a ***SET
\<device\> DEBUG*** command provides the fullest picture of device
operation but may generate very large log files.

Some options enable tracing of periodic events, e.g., a clock tick or a
device poll. Use caution when specifying these options, as the trace log
may fill rapidly. Options that trace periodic behavior are noted in the
option descriptions.

The formats of the trace output are specific to the devices being
traced. Examples are provided in each device description section below.

# Processor Device Simulations

The HP 3000 computer consists of the following subsystems:

-   30003B Central Processing Unit

-   30003B I/O Processor

-   30030C Selector Channel

-   30036B Multiplexer Channel

## Central Processing Unit

The HP 3000 Central Processing Unit contains the microprogrammed machine
instruction execution unit, main memory, and process clock. CPU options
specify the memory size, installed firmware, and simulation
configuration. The CPU is configured with commands of the form:

    SET {-F} CPU <option>

Device options that may be specified are:

|***Option***                     | ***Action***|
|---------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------|
|**128K**                         | Set the memory size to 128K words|
|**256K**                         | Set the memory size to 256K words|
|**384K**                         | Set the memory size to 384K words|
|**512K**                         | Set the memory size to 512K words|
|**768K**                         | Set the memory size to 768K words|
|**1024K**                        | Set the memory size to 1024K words; default for Series III|
|**CIS**                          | Enable the COBOL II Extended Instruction Set firmware|
|**NOCIS**                        | Disable the COBOL II Extended Instruction Set firmware; default|
|**ARS**                          | Enable auto-restart after a power failure; default|
|**NOARS**                        | Disable auto-restart after a power failure|
|**CALTIME**                      | Use calibrated process clock timing; default|
|**REALTIME**                     | Use realistic process clock timing|
|**IDLE**                         | Enable idle detection|
|**NOIDLE**                       | Disable idle detection; default|
|**DUMPDEV=\<n\>**                | Set the dump device number; default is 6|
|**DUMPCTL=\<n\>**                | Set the dump device control value; default is 004|
|**STOP=\<option\>**              | Enable simulation stops|
|**NOSTOP**                       | Disable simulation stops; default|
|**EXEC=\<match\>\[;\<mask\>\]**  | Enable execution tracing of matching instructions|
|**NOEXEC**                       | Disable execution tracing; default|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**             | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**                      | Disable tracing; default|

The initial configuration is a Series III system with 1024K words of
memory. If the memory size is being reduced, and the memory being
truncated contains non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation
before proceeding. The confirmation request may be suppressed by using
the ***--F*** (force) switch. Data in the truncated portion of memory is
lost.

The ***SET CPU CIS*** command simulates the installation of the HP
32234A COBOL II Extended Instruction Set firmware on the ROM PCA and
removal of the W4 jumper from the CIR PCA to enable decoding of the
instructions. The HP 32233A COBOLII/3000 compiler and programs produced
by this compiler require the firmware to execute. If it is not
installed, these programs will abort at run time with *ILLEGAL
INSTRUCTION* errors.

The position of the PF/ARS switch on the back of the system control
panel determines how the CPU responds to AC power returning after a
power failure. In the *enable* position, simulated by the ***SET CPU
ARS*** command, power restoration will initiate an automatic restart of
the operating system. In the *disable* position, simulated by the ***SET
CPU NOARS*** command, power restoration will set up the system for a
restart, which must be performed manually by entering a ***CONTINUE***,
***STEP***, ***GO***, or ***RUN*** command.

Calibrated timing adjusts the process clock to match actual elapsed
time. Realistic timing bases the process-clock interval on machine
instructions executed.

When enabled by a ***SET CPU IDLE*** command, execution of a PAUS
instruction will idle the simulator. While idle, the simulator does not
use any host system processor time. Idle detection requires that the
process clock and system clock be set to calibrated timing. Idling is
disabled by default.

The ***DUMPDEV*** and ***DUMPCTL*** options configure the set of jumpers
on the rear of the CPU front panel that preset the device number and
control value for the cold dump process. These values are used when the
***DUMP*** command is entered without the optional control/device
number. The device number range is 0--127 decimal, and the control value
range is 0--377 octal. The default control value corresponds to the
Write Record tape command.

The ***SET CPU STOP*** command enables one or more simulation stop
conditions. These are described in the Simulation Stops section below.

The ***SET CPU EXEC*** command configures instruction execution tracing.
This command is described in the Tracing section below.

The CPU configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

|***Command***       | ***Action***|
|--------------------| ------------------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW CPU**        | Display the device configuration|
|**SHOW CPU STOPS**  | Display the enabled simulation stops|
|**SHOW CPU EXEC**   | Display the matching criteria for execution tracing|
|**SHOW CPU DUMP**   | Display the cold dump device number and control value|
|**SHOW CPU SPEED**  | Display the current simulation speed|

When the process clock is calibrated, the current simulation speed,
expressed as a multiple of the speed of a real HP 3000 Series III, may
be obtained with the ***SHOW CPU SPEED*** command. The speed reported
will not be representative if the simulator was executing a PAUS
instruction when it was stopped.

### System Halt

The MPE operating system is supported by special microcode features that
perform code and data segment mapping, segment access bounds checking,
privilege checking, etc. The layout of certain in-memory tables is known
to both the OS and the microcode and is used to validate execution of
instructions. For instance, every stack instruction is checked for a
valid access within the stack segment boundaries, which are set up by
the OS before program dispatch. For this reason, the 3000 cannot be
operated as a "bare" machine, because these tables will not have been
initialized. Similarly, the cold load process by which the OS is loaded
from storage media into memory is entirely in microcode, as machine
instructions cannot be executed until the required tables are loaded
into memory.

This OS/microcode integration means that the microcode may detect
conditions that make continued execution impossible. An example would be
an absent segment fault for the segment containing the disc I/O driver.
If such a condition is detected, the CPU does a *system halt*. This
fatal microcode error, distinct from a regular programmed halt, causes
operation to cease until the CPU is reset.

A system halt stops the simulator and reports the system halt code to
the simulation console. The code indicates the reason for the system
halt, as follows:

|***Code***  | ***Reason for System Halt***|
|------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
|**1**       | STT violation while executing in segment 1|
|**2**       | Absent code segment while executing on the ICS|
|**3**       | Code segment 1 is absent|
|**4**       | Stack overflow while executing on the ICS|
|**6**       | I/O device timeout while executing IXIT or cold load|
|**9**       | Dispatcher already enabled while executing PSEB|
|**13**      | CST violation while executing in segment 1|
|**23**      | External interrupts disabled while executing LOCK|
|**33**      | Attempt to trace segment 1|

If a system halt has occurred, simulator execution may not be resumed
until a ***RESET***, ***RESET CPU***, or ***LOAD*** command has been
entered.

### Idling

The PAUS instruction suspends instruction execution until an interrupt
occurs. It is intended to defer instruction fetches from memory to allow
full-bandwidth access by the Selector and Multiplexer Channels. If
enabled, the simulator will idle only during execution of PAUS.

### Simulation Stops

The simulator can be configured to detect certain machine instruction
conditions and stop execution when one or more of them occur. Four stop
options control the simulation stop conditions:

|***Option***  | ***Stop Condition***|
|--------------| ---------------------------------------------------|
|**LOOP**      | Stop when an infinite loop is executed|
|**PAUSE**     | Stop when a PAUS instruction is executed|
|**UNDEF**     | Stop when an undefined instruction is executed|
|**UNIMPL**    | Stop when an unimplemented instruction is executed|

Setting the ***LOOP*** option stops the simulator if it attempts to
execute an instruction that enters an infinite loop (e.g., BR P+0). The
branch instructions TBA, TBX, BCC, BR, BCY, BNCY, BOV, and BNOV result
in an infinite loop if the branch displacement is zero and the branch
condition is true. The remaining branch instructions cannot result in an
infinite loop, as they all modify the CPU state and so eventually will
reach a point where they drop out of their loops.

Setting the ***PAUSE*** option stops the simulator if execution of a
PAUS instruction is attempted. Setting the ***UNDEF*** option stops the
simulator if execution of a non-canonical instruction (i.e., an
instruction containing a decoded reserved bit pattern other than that
defined in the *Machine Instruction Set* manual) is attempted. Setting
the ***UNIMPL*** option stops the simulator if execution of an
unimplemented instruction is attempted.

After a simulation stop, execution may be resumed in one of two ways. If
the cause of the stop has not been remedied and the stop option has not
been disabled, resuming execution with ***CONTINUE***, ***STEP***,
***GO***, or ***RUN*** will cause the stop to occur again. Alternately,
specifying the ***--B*** switch with any of the preceding commands will
resume execution while bypassing the stop for the current instruction.

When the simulator examines the bit patterns of instructions to execute,
each will fall into one of four categories:

1.  Defined (canonical) instruction encodings, where all bits are
    defined or all reserved bits are zero (e.g., LOAD).

5.  Undefined (non-canonical) instruction encodings, where reserved
    fields are "don\'t care" bits (e.g., MOVE).

6.  Undefined (non-canonical) instruction encodings, where reserved
    fields are decoded (e.g., IXIT).

7.  Unimplemented instruction encodings (e.g., stack opcode 072, or EADD
    without the EIS firmware option installed).

Instructions in categories 1 and 2 are always executed. The ***UNDEF***
option stops the simulator for instructions in category 3. The intent is
to catch instructions containing reserved fields with values that change
the meaning of those instructions. The ***UNIMPL*** option stops the
simulator for instructions in category 4.

Bypassing a stop has the following effect:

|***Option***  | ***Bypass Action***|
|--------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
|**LOOP**      | Resume execution of the infinite loop|
|**PAUSE**     | Resume execution with the instruction following PAUS|
|**UNDEF**     | Resume execution with decoding as in the hardware|
|**UNIMPL**    | Resume execution with an Unimplemented Instruction trap|

Note that the ***PAUSE*** action corresponds in hardware to pressing the
HALT button and then the RUN button. If the stop conditions are
disabled, the simulator performs the actions above, except that PAUS
suspends instruction execution until a device interrupt occurs.

### Tracing

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| ----------------------------------------|
|**INSTR**     | Machine instructions executed|
|**DATA**      | Memory data accesses|
|**FETCH**     | Memory instruction fetches|
|**REG**       | Register values|

The ***INSTR*** option traces instruction executions. Each instruction
is printed before it is executed. The two opcodes of a stack instruction
are printed together before the left-hand opcode is executed. If the
right-hand opcode is not NOP, it is reprinted before execution, with
dashes replacing the just-executed left-hand opcode.

The ***DATA*** option traces reads from and writes to memory. Each
access is classified by the memory bank register that is paired with the
specified offset --- DMA, absolute, program, data, or stack. DMA
(channel) accesses derive their bank addresses from the banks specified
by Set Bank I/O program orders. Absolute accesses always use bank 0.
Program, data, and stack accesses use the bank addresses in the PBANK,
DBANK, and SBANK registers, respectively.

The ***FETCH*** option traces instruction fetches from memory. These
accesses are separated from those traced by the ***DATA*** option
because fetches usually are of little interest except when debugging the
fetch/execute sequence. Because the HP 3000 has a two-stage pipeline,
fetches load the NIR (Next Instruction Register) with the instruction
after the instruction about to be executed from the CIR (Current
Instruction Register).

The ***REG*** option traces register values. Two sets of registers may
be printed. After executing each instruction, the currently active TOS
registers, the index register, and the status register are printed.
After executing an instruction that may alter the base registers, the
program, data, and stack segment base registers are printed.

The ***OPND*** option traces memory byte operand values. Some
instructions take memory and register operands that are difficult to
decode from ***DATA*** or ***REG*** traces. This option presents these
operands in a higher-level format. The memory bank and address values
are always those of the operands. The operand data and values printed
are specific to the instruction. For example, the ALGN instruction
prints its source and target operands, digit counts, and fraction
counts, and the EDIT instruction displays its subprogram operations.

The ***EXEC*** option traces the execution of instructions that match
user-specified criteria. When a match occurs, all CPU trace options are
turned on for the duration of the execution of the matched instruction.
The prior trace settings are restored when a match fails. This option
allows detailed tracing of specified instructions while minimizing the
log file size compared to a full instruction trace.

The ***SET CPU EXEC*** command configures the match and mask values used
to qualify instructions for execution tracing. Qualification is
performed by ANDing the current instruction with the specified *mask*
value and then comparing the result with the specified *match* value. If
the *mask* value is omitted, the *match* value must match the
instruction exactly. The values are entered in the CPU's data radix,
which defaults to octal but may be set to a different radix or
overridden by a switch on the command line.

Setting the *mask* value allows matching a range of instructions or an
instruction with a range of operand values. For example, ***SET CPU
EXEC=020460;177760*** will trace execution of all COBOL-II firmware
instructions, ***SET CPU EXEC=054000;077000*** will trace execution of
FDIV instructions, and ***SET CPU EXEC=031000*** will trace execution of
PCAL 0 instructions. To trace a stack instruction, configure the match
for the opcode in the left-hand position only; this will match the
opcode in either position.

The ***PSERV*** option traces process clock event service entries. Each
trace reports whether the CPU was executing on the Interrupt Control
Stack or the user stack when the process clock ticked. Execution on the
ICS implies that the operating system is executing. As the process clock
ticks every millisecond, enabling ***PSERV*** tracing can quickly
produce a large number of trace lines.

The trace formats are interpreted as follows:

    >>CPU instr: 00.010341 000300 ZROX,NOP

    Items:
        Octal bank (PBANK)

        Octal address (effective address)
        Instruction-specific data value
        Instruction-specific operand value

    >>CPU pserv: Process clock service entered on the ICS

    Service entry and stack status

For ***OPND*** traces of byte-array operands, the data values printed
are the relative byte addresses. For EDIT subprogram operations, the
value of the loop counter is printed.

Enabling CPU tracing can produce a very large number of lines very
quickly, so care should be used to enable tracing only around the area
of interest. Breakpoint actions may be used to implement this; for
example:

    BREAK 100; SET CPU DEBUG; GO
    BREAK 200; SET CPU NODEBUG; GO

These commands will enable tracing when the program counter reaches
location 100 and disable tracing when it reaches location 200, thereby
producing a trace of instructions executed between locations 100 and
200. Alternately, if the execution of specific instructions is of
interest, the ***EXEC*** trace option may be used to reduce the debug
log file size.

### Registers

The CPU state contains the registers visible to the programmer and the
interrupt system control registers:

The CIR and NIR registers default to CPU instruction mnemonic format,
and the STA register defaults to CPU status mnemonic format for display
and entry but may be overridden with a numeric-format switch, if
desired. The RA, RB, RC, RD, X, and SWCH registers may be examined or
deposited using any of the modes described in the Symbolic Display and
Entry section above.

Two additional, hidden, read-only registers may be displayed if
mentioned explicitly. CNTR represents the hardware counter used by the
microcode. When a PAUS or HALT instruction is executed, the microcode
stores the value of the SR register in the CNTR register before flushing
the TOS registers to memory (so SR is always zero after executing either
instruction). The MOD register holds the module number during an
unsolicited module interrupt. CNTR and MOD are provided for the CPU
diagnostic and have no other use under simulation.

## I/O Processor

The HP 30003B I/O Processor works in conjunction with the CPU and
Multiplexer Channel to service the device interfaces. All I/O interfaces
are connected to the IOP bus, which transfers direct I/O orders to the
interfaces and handles memory reads and writes between the interfaces
and the CPU stack. In addition, it provides the memory interface for
Multiplexer Channel transfers, as well as fetching I/O program orders
from main memory for the channel.

The IOP device has no configuration options. It does provide tracing,
though, with selectable filtering by device number, using these device
options:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| ------------------------------------------------|
|**FILTER=\<list\>**   | Suppress tracing for device numbers in the list|
|**NOFILTER**          | Enable tracing for all device numbers; default|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|

Enabling IOP tracing can produce a very large number of trace lines very
quickly, so care should be used to enable tracing only around the area
of interest. If only certain devices are of interest, others may be
filtered out of the results by specifying their device numbers in a
***SET IOP FILTER*** command. This command takes a list of individual
device numbers separated by semicolons and ranges of the form
***low-high***. For example, ***SET IOP FILTER=3;7-9*** would exclude
lines pertaining to device numbers 3, 7, 8, and 9 from the trace report.

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------|
|**DIO**       | Direct I/O orders issued|
|**IRQ**       | Interrupt requests received|
|**DATA**      | Multiplexer Channel memory data accesses|

The ***DIO*** option traces direct I/O orders that are sent to devices.
The ***IRQ*** option traces interrupt requests received and granted. The
***DATA*** option traces memory accesses performed on behalf of the
Multiplexer Channel. Each access is classified as either an absolute
access in memory bank 0 or a DMA access in the memory bank specified by
a Set Bank I/O program order.

The trace formats are interpreted as follows:

    >>IOP dio: Test I/O order sent to device number 3

      I/O order and device number

    >>IOP irq: Device number 6 acknowledged interrupt request at priority 14

      Device number and interrupt priority number

    >>IOP data: 00.001400 040000 dma write
    >>IOP data: 00.000030 001434 absolute read

      Octal bank number
      Octal address
      Octal data (memory contents)
      Memory access classification

The I/O Processor state contains these registers:

|***Name***  | ***Size*** |  ***Radix***|   ***Read-Only***|   ***Description***|
|------------| -----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
|**IOA**     | 8          |  8          |   &#10003;      |      I/O Address Register|

## Selector Channel

The HP 30030C Selector Channel provides high-speed data transfer between
a device and main memory. While several interfaces may be connected to
the selector channel bus, only one transfer is active at a time, and the
channel remains dedicated to that interface until the transfer is
complete. The channel contains its own memory port controller, so
transfers to and from memory bypass the I/O Processor.

Once started by an SIO instruction, the channel executes I/O programs
independently of the CPU. Program words are read, and device status is
written back, directly via the port controller.

The SEL device has no configuration options. It does provide tracing,
though, using these device options:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| -------------------------|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| --------------------------------------------|
|**CSRW**      | Channel command initiations and completions|
|**PIO**       | Programmed I/O orders executed|
|**STATE**     | Channel state changes executed|
|**SR**        | Service requests received|
|**DATA**      | Channel memory data accesses|

The ***CSRW*** option traces the beginning and ending of channel
programs. The ***PIO*** option traces programmed I/O orders that are
sent to devices. The ***STATE*** option traces the entries into each of
the internal channel execution states. The ***SR*** option traces
service requests received from the device. The ***DATA*** option traces
memory accesses performed by the port controller. Each access is
classified as either an absolute access in memory bank 0 or a DMA access
in the memory bank specified by a Set Bank I/O program order.

The trace formats are interpreted as follows:

    >>SEL csrw: Device number 4 asserted REQ for channel initialization
    >>SEL pio: Channel loaded IOCW 040000 (Control) from address 102757
    >>SEL state: Channel entered the Fetch sequence with 14 clock cycles remaining
    >>SEL sr: Device number 4 asserted CHANSR

      Operational message

    >>SEL data: 00.041746 000000 dma write
    >>SEL data: 00.000020 102757 absolute read

      Octal bank number
      Octal address
      Octal data (memory contents)
      Memory access classification

The Selector Channel state contains these registers:

|***Name***  | ***Size*** |  ***Radix***|   ***Symbolic***|   ***Description***|
|------------| -----------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|**IDLE**    | 1          |  2          |                |    Channel is inactive|

The INBUF and OUTBUF registers may be examined or deposited using any of
the modes described in the Symbolic Display and Entry section above.

## Multiplexer Channel

The HP 30036B Multiplexer Channel provides high-speed data transfer
between from one to sixteen devices and main memory. Concurrent
transfers for multiple devices are multiplexed on a per-word basis,
dependent on the service request priorities assigned to the
participating interfaces. Interfaces must have additional hardware to be
channel-capable, as the channel uses separate control and data signals
from those used for direct I/O. In addition, the multiplexer and
selector channels differ somewhat in their use of the signals, so
interfaces are generally designed for use with one or the other (the
Selector Channel Maintenance Board is a notable exception that uses
jumpers to indicate which channel to use).

Once started by an SIO instruction, the channel executes I/O programs
independently of the CPU. Program words are read, and device status is
written back, by calls to the I/O Processor.

The MPX device supports configuration of the device number used for the
diagnostic interface and of tracing using these device options:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| --------------------------------------|
|**DEVNO=\<n\>**       | Set the device number; default is 127|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
|**CSRW**      | Channel control, status, read, and write actions|
|**PIO**       | Programmed I/O commands issued|
|**STATE**     | Channel state changes executed|
|**SR**        | Service requests received|
|**IOBUS**     | I/O bus signals and data words received and returned|

The ***CSRW*** option traces the beginning and ending of channel
programs, as well as control, status, read, and write commands sent to
the diagnostic interface. The ***PIO*** option traces programmed I/O
orders that are sent to devices. The ***STATE*** option traces the
entries into each of the internal channel execution states. The ***SR***
option traces service requests received from the devices. The
***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals and data received
and returned via the diagnostic interface. As the Multiplexer Channel
uses the I/O Processor as its interface to main memory, channel memory
access tracing is enabled by the IOP ***DATA*** trace option.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

    >>MPX  csrw: Device number 65 asserted REQ for channel initialization
    >>MPX  csrw: Control is address RAM | load registers | RAM address 15
    >>MPX   pio: Channel SR 0 loaded IOCW 050000 (Sense) from address 021207
    >>MPX state: Channel SR 3 entered State C
    >>MPX    sr: Device number 65 asserted SR0
    >>MPX iobus: Received data 000200 with signals DCONTSTB

The control, status, read, and write values, and the I/O bus signals are
decoded and presented in symbolic format for easier interpretation.

The Multiplexer Channel state contains these registers:

|***Name***          | ***Size*** |  ***Radix***|   ***Description***|
|--------------------| -----------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
|**IDLE**            | 1          |  2          |   Channel is inactive|
|**COUNT**           | 32         |  10         |   Count of active transfers|

# Programmed I/O Device Simulations

The CPU controls these I/O device interfaces with direct I/O
instructions:

-   30032B Asynchronous Terminal Controller
-   30033A Selector Channel Maintenance Board
-   30135A System Clock

## 30032B Asynchronous Terminal Controller

The HP 30032B Asynchronous Terminal Controller is a 16-channel terminal
multiplexer used with the HP 3000 CX through Series III systems. The ATC
connects from 1 to 16 serial terminals or modems to the HP 3000 at
programmable baud rates from 75 to 2400 bits per second. Character sizes
are also programmable from 5 to 12 bits in length, including the start
and stop bits. Each channel can be independently configured, including
for separate send and receive rates. The ATC is not buffered, so the CPU
has to retrieve each character from a given channel before the next
character arrives. To avoid saturating the CPU with interrupt requests,
the ATC maintains an internal \"mini-interrupt\" system that queues
requests and holds additional interrupts off until the CPU acknowledges
the current request.

The HP 3000CX and Series I use a dedicated serial interface for the
system console, while user terminals are connected to the ATC. For the
Series II and III, the separate card is eliminated, and channel 0 of the
ATC is reserved for the console.

The ATC consists of two devices:

-   ATCD --- the Terminal Data Interface (TDI)
-   ATCC --- the Terminal Control Interface (TCI)

The Terminal Data Interface provides the serial data line connections
for terminals and data sets. Five additional receive-only auxiliary
channels may be connected as a group under software control to one of
the sixteen main lines to detect the incoming baud rate. The Terminal
Control Interface provides serial control and status lines for Bell 103
data sets.

### Terminal Data Interface

The TDI provides the Transmitted Data (BA) and Received Data (BB) lines
for up to sixteen terminals. It performs input and output through Telnet
sessions connected to a user-specified port or through individually
specified host serial ports. The TDI supports concurrent Telnet and
serial connections. The ***ATTACH*** command specifies the local port to
be used for Telnet connections:

    ATTACH ATCD <port>

...where ***port*** is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not
being used for other TCP/IP activities. When the TDI is attached and the
simulator is running, the multiplexer listens for connections on the
specified port and assigns them to channels in ascending numeric order.

The ***ATTACH*** command is also used to specify the host serial port
for individual TDI channels:

    ATTACH {--V} ATCD
    LINE=<chan>,CONNECT=<name>{;<rate>-<size><parity><stopbits>}

...where ***chan*** is the TDI channel number from 1-15, and ***name***
is the host name of the serial port to use (e.g., *ser0* or *COM1*). If
the ***--V*** (verbose) option is included, a connection confirmation
message will be output to the port.

An optional serial port configuration string may be supplied after the
host name. The required values are:

-   ***rate*** is the baud rate in bits per second.

-   ***size*** is the character size in bits including the parity bit,
    if designated.

-   ***parity*** designates the parity to use: *N* (no), *E* (even), *O*
    (odd), *M* (mark), or *S* (space).

-   ***stopbits*** is the number of stop bits (*1*, *1.5*, or *2*).

Serial connections default to 9600 baud, 8-bit characters, no parity,
and one stop bit.

TDI configuration options are available for the device and for the
individual units. The command forms are:

    SET ATCD <device-option>
    SET ATCDn <unit-option>

Device options that may be specified are:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| ----------------------------------------------|
|**FASTTIME**          | Use optimized timing; default|
|**REALTIME**          | Use realistic timing|
|**TERMINAL**          | Connect using Telnet or serial ports; default|
|**DIAGNOSTIC**        | Connect using diagnostic test cables|
|**DEVNO=\<n\>**       | Set the device number; default is 7|
|**INTMASK=\<n\>**     | Set the interrupt mask; default is E|
|**INTPRI=\<n\>**      | Set the interrupt priority; default is 0|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|
|**ENABLED**           | Enable the device; default|
|**DISABLED**          | Disable the device|

The TDI supports programmable data transfer rates from 75 to 2400 baud.
When realistic timing is enabled, the simulation accurately models the
transmission and reception baud rates (in machine instructions). For
example, a port set for 1200 baud will take twice as long to output a
given listing as a port set for 2400 baud. Optimized timing reduces the
timing to the minimum necessary to operate correctly; this is much
faster than the real terminal multiplexer would operate.

The delay time used by the simulation in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set
via the register interface. This value may be adjusted as necessary to
work around any HP 3000 software problems that are triggered by the
abnormally rapid TDI operation. Resetting the device with the ***RESET
--P*** (power-on reset) command restores the original optimized time.

Enabling the diagnostic mode simulates the installation of eight HP
30062-60003 diagnostic test (loopback) cables between channels 0-1, 2-3,
etc., as required by the multiplexer diagnostic. Each cable connects the
Send Data line of one channel to the Receive Data line of the other
channel, and vice versa. In addition, all sessions are disconnected, and
the multiplexer is detached from the Telnet listening port. While in
diagnostic mode, the ***ATTACH ATCD*** command is not allowed. Enabling
terminal mode allows the multiplexer to be attached to accept incoming
connections again.

Unit options that may be specified for individual TDI channels are:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**LOCALACK**          | Discard ENQ and reply with ACK internally; default|
|**REMOTEACK**         | Transmit ENQ and receive ACK from the remote device|
|**CAPSLOCK**          | Upshift lowercase input characters to uppercase; default for channel 0|
|**NOCAPSLOCK**        | Input characters are unchanged; default for channels 1-15|
|**UC**                | Upshift lowercase output characters to uppercase|
|**7B**                | Output with high-order bit cleared; default for channels 1-15|
|**7P**                | Output with high-order bit cleared, non-printing suppressed; default for channel 0|
|**8B**                | Output characters without changing|
|**LOG=\<filename\>**  | Enable output logging|
|**NOLOG**             | Disable output logging; default|
|**DISCONNECT**        | Disconnect the channel|

Channels that are configured for MPE terminal type 10 expect HP
terminals or terminal emulators to be connected and will handshake
transfers by sending an ENQ and expecting an ACK in reply. A device that
does not provide ENQ/ACK handshaking will hang during output. However,
if ***LOCALACK*** is specified, the handshake will take place locally
within the simulator. The ENQ will be discarded, and a locally generated
ACK will be returned to the caller. In addition to enabling the use of
non-HP terminals, this option significantly improves the performance of
common HP terminal emulators. Specifying ***REMOTEACK*** will pass ENQ
to the terminal for handling; this is necessary to avoid output overruns
if a real HP terminal is connected to a serial port.

Some HP 3000 programs, e.g., SLEUTH, require command input in upper
case, although mixed-case output is supported. As an aid to avoid
toggling the host keyboard in and out of CAPS LOCK mode, the multiplexer
provides this function locally. The default modes are ***CAPSLOCK*** for
channel 0 (the system console) and ***NOCAPSLOCK*** for the other
channels.

Each channel may be set to one of four output modes (***UC***, ***7B***,
***7P***, or ***8B***). The default mode is ***7P*** for channel 0 and
***7B*** for the other channels. If the system console is set to MPE
terminal type 10, the mode must be changed to ***7B*** or ***8B*** to
allow ESC, DC1, and ENQ characters to pass through to the terminal.
Alternatively, the ***SET CONSOLE PCHAR*** command may be used to
redefine the set of printable characters. Modes ***UC*** and ***7P***
are compatible with terminal types 0-9.

File transfer using the Reflection terminal emulator requires an 8-bit
data path. To achieve this, the session must use MPE terminal type 12
(this may be configured either during a system reload or by specifying
the ***TERM=12*** parameter when logging on with ***:HELLO***), and the
channel must be set to ***8B***, ***REMOTEACK***, and ***NOCAPSLOCK***
modes.

Each channel supports independent I/O logging to a file. Disabling
logging also closes the log file.

A channel may be manually disconnected from its associated Telnet
session with the ***SET ATCDn DISCONNECT*** command. Otherwise, the
connection will remain open until disconnected either by the Telnet
client or a ***DETACH ATCD*** command, unless the channel is controlled
by the TCI. For a serial connection, the command will drop and then
raise the Data Terminal Ready line; to disconnect the serial port,
include the ***--C*** switch in the command.

TDI device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

|***Command***              | ***Action***|
|---------------------------| ------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW ATCD**              | Display the device and unit configuration|
|**SHOW ATCD MODES**        | Display the connection modes|
|**SHOW ATCD CONNECTIONS**  | Display the channel connections|
|**SHOW ATCD STATISTICS**   | Display the channel I/O statistics|
|**SHOW ATCD DEVNO**        | Display the device number assignment|
|**SHOW ATCD INTMASK**      | Display the interrupt mask setting|
|**SHOW ATCD INTPRI**       | Display the interrupt priority assignment|

TDI unit configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

|***Command***           | ***Action***|
|------------------------| --------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW ATCD\<n\>**      | Display the selected channel configuration|
|**SHOW ATCD\<n\> LOG**  | Display the selected channel logging status|

In addition to the current configuration settings, a channel controlled
by the TCI will be marked *data set* in the listing; a channel not
controlled will be marked *direct*.

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
|**CSRW**      | Interface control, status, read, and write actions|
|**SERV**      | Line unit service events|
|**PSERV**     | Poll unit service events (periodic)|
|**XFER**      | Data receptions and transmissions|
|**IOBUS**     | I/O bus signals and data words received and returned|

The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands
sent to the interface. The ***SERV*** option traces line unit event
service scheduling and entries. The line service is entered to transmit
or receive each character at the configured baud rate. The ***PSERV***
option traces poll unit event service entries. The poll service is
entered once every 10 milliseconds to poll the Telnet port for
connections and input characters to be received by the active channels.
The ***XFER*** option traces the characters received and transmitted by
the active channels. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane
signals and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

    >>ATCD  cmds: Status is DIO OK | complete | send
    >>ATCD  serv: Channel 0 delay 1708 service scheduled
    >>ATCD pserv: Poll service entered
    >>ATCD  xfer: Channel 0 character 'G' sent
    >>ATCD iobus: Received data 000000 with signals DREADSTB

The Terminal Data Interface state contains these registers:

|***Name***          | ***Size*** |  ***Radix***|   ***Symbolic***|   ***Action***|
|--------------------| -----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|

|**FTIME**           | 24         |  10         |                | Fast receive/send time|
|**RSTAT \[0:20\]**  | 16         |  8          |                | Receive channel status, channels 0-20|
|**RPARM \[0:20\]**  | 16         |  8          |                | Receive channel parameters, channels 0-|

|**SPARM \[0:15\]**  | 16         |  8          |                | Send channel parameters, channels 0-15|
|**SBUFR \[0:15\]**  | 16         |  8          |   &#10003;     | Send channel buffers, channels 0-15|

The READ, WRITE, RBUFR, and SBUFR registers may be examined or deposited
using any of the modes described in the Symbolic Display and Entry
section above.

### Terminal Control Interface

The TCI provides the Request to Send (CA) and Data Terminal Ready (CD)
control lines, and the Data Set Ready (CC) and Carrier Detect (CF)
status lines for each of sixteen terminals or data sets. The modem
controls model the Bell 103A data set without ring detection.

Data Terminal Ready must be set to enable a channel to accept an
incoming connection. When a channel connects, Data Set Ready and Carrier
Detect will be set. Configuring the terminal subtype to 1 in MPE will
enable the TCI to establish these settings. In addition, aborting a
session will drop Data Terminal Ready after the user is logged out,
which will drop the Telnet connection. If the user drops the Telnet
connection manually, the session will be logged out. These actions will
not occur for channels configured for terminal subtype 0 in MPE, which
does not use the TCI.

ATCC device options that may be specified are:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| ----------------------------------------------|
|**TERMINAL**          | Connect using Telnet or serial ports; default|
|**DIAGNOSTIC**        | Connect using diagnostic test cables|
|**DEVNO=\<n\>**       | Set the device number; default is 8|
|**INTMASK=\<n\>**     | Set the interrupt mask; default is E|
|**INTPRI=\<n\>**      | Set the interrupt priority; default is 8|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|
|**ENABLED**           | Enable the device; default|
|**DISABLED**          | Disable the device|

Enabling the diagnostic mode simulates the installation of eight HP
30062-60003 diagnostic test (loopback) cables between channels 0-1, 2-3,
etc., as required by the multiplexer diagnostic. Each cable connects the
Data Terminal Ready and Request to Send lines, respectively, of one
channel to the Data Set Ready and Carrier Detect lines of the other
channel, and vice versa. Enabling terminal mode allows the multiplexer
to respond to incoming connections again.

There are no TCI units or unit commands.

TCI device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

|***Command***          | ***Action***|
|-----------------------| ------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW ATCC**          | Display the device configuration|
|**SHOW ATCC MODE**     | Display the connection mode|
|**SHOW ATCC DEVNO**    | Display the device number assignment|
|**SHOW ATCC INTMASK**  | Display the interrupt mask setting|
|**SHOW ATCC INTPRI**   | Display the interrupt priority assignment|

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
|**CSRW**      | Interface control, status, read, and write actions|
|**PSERV**     | Poll unit service events (periodic)|
|**XFER**      | Control and status line changes|
|**IOBUS**     | I/O bus signals and data words received and returned|

The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands
sent to the interface. The ***PSERV*** option traces poll unit event
service entries. The poll service is entered once every 10 milliseconds
to poll the channels for changes in the control or status lines. The
***XFER*** option traces the changes in control and status lines by the
active channels. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O backplane signals
and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

    >>ATCC csrw: Channel 2 control is C2 | C1 | ~S2 | ~S1
    >>ATCC pserv: Poll service entered
    >>ATCC xfer: Channel 2 line status is RTS | DTR
    >>ATCC iobus: Received data 031374 with signals DCONTSTB

The Terminal Control Interface state contains these registers:

|***Name***        | ***Size*** |  ***Radix***|   ***Description***|
|------------------| -----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|**CNTL**          | 16         |  8          |   Control register|

## 30033A Selector Channel Maintenance Board

The HP 30033A Selector Channel Maintenance Board provides the circuitry
necessary to test the I/O bus signals driven and received by the
Selector and Multiplexer Channels. Used with the Stand-Alone Selector
Channel and Multiplexer Channel diagnostics, the SCMB is used to verify
that the correct bus signals are driven in response to each of the
programmed I/O orders, and that the channel responds correctly to the
signals returned to it. The SCMB functions as a programmable interface
that can log incoming signals and drive the outgoing signals, as well as
simulate a number of interface hardware faults. Two SCMBs are provided;
they are named *SCMB1* and *SCMB2*.

Both SCMBs are normally disabled, as they are used only with the
standalone diagnostics. The CPU and Selector Channel diagnostics both
use one SCMB. If SCMB1 is used, it may be referred to as *SCMB* if
desired. The Multiplexer Channel diagnostic uses both SCMBs.

Device options that may be specified for the two SCMBs are:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------|
|**SC**                | Connect the SCMB to the Selector Channel bus|
|**MX**                | Connect the SCMB to the Multiplexer Channel bus; default|
|**DEVNO=\<n\>**       | Set the device number; defaults are 65 and 66|
|**INTPRI=\<n\>**      | Set the interrupt priority; defaults are 10 and 11|
|**SRNO=\<n\>**        | Set the service request number; defaults are 0 and 1|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|
|**ENABLED**           | Enable device|
|**DISABLED**          | Disable device; default|

The ***SC*** option installs the SCMB on the Selector Channel bus and
configures operation for the Selector Channel diagnostic. The ***MX***
option installs the SCMB on the Multiplexer Channel bus and configures
operation for the Multiplexer Channel and CPU diagnostics. The
***SRNO*** value may be changed only when the SCMB is connected to the
Multiplexer Channel bus.

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
|**CSRW**      | Interface control, status, read, and write actions|
|**XFER**      | Data read and write transfers|
|**SERV**      | SR delay service events|
|**IOBUS**     | I/O bus signals and data words received and returned|

The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands
sent to the interface. The ***XFER*** option traces data words
transferred to and from the interface by the channel. The ***SERV***
option traces event service scheduling and entries used to schedule
delays in the service requests to the channel. The ***IOBUS*** option
traces the I/O backplane signals and data received and returned via the
interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

    >>SCMB1 csrw: Control is device end | load control IOAW | count nothing

## 30135A System Clock

The HP 30135A System Clock is used with Series II and III systems and
provides a programmable interval clock employed as the MPE time-of-day
and process-switching clock. The clock provides programmable periods of
10 microseconds to 10 seconds in decade increments. Each "tick" of the
clock increments a presettable counter that may be compared to a
selected limit value. The clock may request an interrupt when the values
are equal, and a status indication is provided if the counter reaches
the limit a second time without acknowledgement.

CLK device options that may be specified are:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| -----------------------------------------|
|**CALTIME**           | Use calibrated timing; default|
|**REALTIME**          | Use realistic timing|
|**DEVNO=\<n\>**       | Set the device number; default is 3|
|**INTPRI=\<n\>**      | Set the interrupt priority; default is 1|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|
|**ENABLED**           | Enable the device; default|
|**DISABLED**          | Disable the device|

Calibrated timing aligns the simulated clock periods with the clock on
the host system. When calibrated, each of the programmable periods will
elapse after the corresponding amount of host-system time.

When realistic timing is enabled, the simulation models the programmable
periods in terms of machine instructions executed. Calibrated timing is
required to enable idling. Realistic timing is necessary to pass the
hardware diagnostics.

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
|**CSRW**      | Interface control, status, read, and write actions|
|**PSERV**     | Clock unit service events (periodic)|
|**IOBUS**     | I/O bus signals and data words received and returned|

The ***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands
sent to the interface. The ***PSERV*** option traces event service
scheduling and entries, which occur at a periodic rate dependent on the
programmable configuration. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the I/O
backplane signals and data received and returned via the interface.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

    >>CLK  csrw: Control is load rate | select limit | 1 millisecond rate
    >>CLK  csrw: Status is DIO OK | LR = CR | limit selected | 1 millisecond rate
    >>CLK pserv: Service entered with counter 0 increment 1 limit 1
    >>CLK pserv: Rate 1 millisecond delay 389 service rescheduled
    >>CLK iobus: Received data 000000 with signals DSETINT
    >>CLK iobus: Returned data 000000 with signals INTREQ

The System Clock state contains these registers:

|***Name***  | ***Size*** |  ***Radix***|   ***Description***|
|------------| -----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|**CNTL**    | 16         |  8          |   Control Register|

# Selector Channel I/O Device Simulations

The Selector Channel controls these I/O device interfaces:

-   30229B Disc Interface

## 30229B Disc Interface with Eight 7905/7906/7920/7925 Drives

The HP 30129A Cartridge Disc Subsystem connects the 7905A, 7906A, 7920A,
and 7925A disc drives to the HP 3000. The subsystem consists of a 30229B
Cartridge Disc Interface, a 13037D Multiple-Access Disc Controller
(\"MAC\"), and from one to eight MAC drives. The subsystem uses the
Selector Channel to achieve a 937.5 KB/second transfer rate to the CPU.

The disc controller connects from one to eight HP 7905 (15 MB), 7906 (20
MB), 7920 (50 MB), or 7925 (120 MB) disc drives to interfaces installed
in from one to eight CPUs. The drives use a common command set and
present data to the controller synchronously at a 468.75 kiloword per
second (2.133 microseconds per word) data rate.

The disc interface is used to connect the HP 3000 CPU to the 13037's
device controller. While the controller supports multiple-CPU systems,
the HP 3000 does not use this capability.

The simulation provides up to eight disc drives. Drive types may be
intermixed; 7905s are selected by default. Attaching a disc image file
to a unit simulates inserting a disc pack into a drive:

    ATTACH {-R} DSn <image-filename>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch is equivalent to setting the
drive's Disc Protect switch on.

If the host operating system returns an error when seeking, reading, or
writing a disc image file, the simulator will report the error to the
simulation console, e.g.:

    HP 3000 simulator disc library I/O error: No space left on device

A simulated disc seek will fail with Status 2 Error (Drive Fault)
status, and the drive's heads will unload. Reloading the heads will
clear the drive fault. A simulated disc read or write will fail with
Uncorrectable Data Error status. The target operating system will then
react to this error as though a real drive had encountered a bad disc
sector.

A drive's unit number is not set explicitly. Instead, the drive unit
number is derived from the simulation unit number. For example, unit DS0
responds to disc unit select number 0. Changing the unit select switch
on a mounted drive is equivalent to detaching and reattaching the disc
image file to the corresponding simulation unit.

Device and unit options include configuring the timing, drive type,
protection and format status, and the ability to set drives ready or
not-ready. The command forms are:

    SET DS <device-option>
    SET DSn <unit-option>

### Device Options

Device options that may be specified are:

|***Option***               | ***Action***|
|---------------------------| ----------------------------------------------|
|**FASTTIME**               | Use optimized timing; default|
|**REALTIME**               | Use realistic timing|
|**DIAGNOSTIC**             | Reset the diagnostic override table|
|**DIAGNOSTIC=\<params\>**  | Add an entry to the diagnostic override table|
|**NODIAGNOSTIC**           | Clear the diagnostic override table; default|
|**DEVNO=\<n\>**            | Set the device number; default is 4|
|**INTMASK=\<n\>**          | Set the interrupt mask; default is E|
|**INTPRI=\<n\>**           | Set the interrupt priority; default is 4|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**       | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**                | Disable tracing; default|
|**ENABLED**                | Enable the device; default|
|**DISABLED**               | Disable the device|

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

|***Command***           | ***Action***|
|------------------------| ------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW DS**             | Display the device and unit configuration|
|**SHOW DS DIAGNOSTIC**  | Display the diagnostic override table|
|**SHOW DS TIMING**      | Display the timing mode|

When realistic timing is enabled, the simulation accurately models the
disc movement times (in machine instructions). For example, seeking
takes longer if the positioner movement distance is farther. Optimized
timing reduces the timing to the minimum necessary to operate correctly;
this is much faster than a real disc drive would operate.

The delay times used by the simulation in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set
via the register interface. The values may be adjusted as necessary to
work around any HP 3000 software problems that are triggered by the
abnormally rapid disc operation. Resetting the device with the ***RESET
--P*** (power-on reset) command restores the original optimized times.

The ***SET DS DIAGNOSTIC*** and ***SET DS NODIAGNOSTIC*** commands
provide diagnostic support. See the Diagnostic Support section below for
details.

### Unit Options

Unit options that may be specified for individual disc drives are:

|***Option***         | ***Action***|
|---------------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------|
|**7905**             | Set the drive type to 7905; default|
|**7906**             | Set the drive type to 7906|
|**7920**             | Set the drive type to 7920|
|**7925**             | Set the drive type to 7925|
|**UNLOAD**           | Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Stop*; default when detached|
|**LOAD**             | Set the drive's Run/Stop switch to *Run*; default when attached|
|**PROTECT**          | Set the 7920's or 7925's Read Only switch to *On*|
|**PROTECT=UPPER**    | Set the 7905's or 7906's Protect Upper Disc switch to *On*|
|**PROTECT=LOWER**    | Set the 7905's or 7906's Protect Lower Disc switch to *On*|
|**UNPROTECT**        | Set the 7920's or 7925's Read Only switch to *Off*|
|**UNPROTECT=UPPER**  | Set the 7905's or 7906's Protect Upper Disc switch to *Off*|
|**UNPROTECT=LOWER**  | Set the 7905's or 7906's Protect Lower Disc switch to *Off*|
|**FORMAT**           | Set the drive's Format switch to *Enabled*|
|**NOFORMAT**         | Set the drive's Format switch to *Disabled*; default|
|**ENABLED**          | Enable the unit; default|
|**DISABLED**         | Disable the unit|

The ***UNOAD*** and ***LOAD*** options unload and load the drive\'s
heads from the disc pack, setting the drive not-ready and ready,
respectively. The former provides a convenient method of setting a drive
\"down\" without detaching the associated disc image file.

***PROTECT=UPPER*** and ***PROTECT=LOWER*** protect the upper and lower
platters, respectively, of 7905 and 7906 drives from writing;
***PROTECT*** without a value protects both platters. For the 7920 and
7925 drives, ***PROTECT*** protects the entire drive. The
***UNPROTECT*** options remove drive protection and enable writing.

The ***FORMAT*** option enables certain controller commands, such as
Initialize, that alter the sector address fields. Typically, this option
is needed when reloading the operating system from tape to disc. The
***NOFORMAT*** option inhibits these commands and permits only the
standard Write command, subject to the appropriate drive protection
status.

Drive configuration may be displayed with the following command:

|***Command***     | ***Action***|
|------------------| -------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW DS\<n\>**  | Display the selected drive's configuration|

### Diagnostic Support

The offline disc diagnostic (program D419A) tests features of the disc
that are not supported in simulation, e.g., the detection and correction
of sector data errors. However, the simulation does support recovery
from host file system errors, which are mapped to uncorrectable data
errors. Because file system errors cannot be generated intentionally, a
table of diagnostic overrides is provided to return specified error
status values instead of otherwise normal completion status. This allows
the error recovery simulation code to be tested.

The initially empty diagnostic override table may be populated with one
or more entries using this command:

    SET DS DIAGNOSTIC=<cylinder>;<head>;<sector>;<opcode>;<SPD>;<status>

...where:

-   ***cylinder*** is a decimal value from 0 to 822.

-   ***head*** is a decimal value from 0 to 8.

-   ***sector*** is a decimal value from 0 to 63.

-   ***opcode*** is an octal value from 0 to 26.

-   ***SPD*** is any combination of the letters S, P, and D.

-   ***status*** is an octal value from 0 to 37.

If a command specifies the opcode value as 15 (Request Syndrome) and the
status value as 17 (Correctable Data Error), then four additional values
must be appended to the command line above:

    ;<displacement>;<syndrome 1>;<syndrome 2>;<syndrome 3>

...where:

-   ***displacement*** is a decimal value from --5 to 135.

-   ***syndrome 1-3*** are octal values from 0 to 177777.

When the table is populated, the first entry becomes the initial
"current" entry. As the diagnostic program issues each disc controller
command, the cylinder, head, sector, and command opcode values from the
current override entry are checked against the corresponding current
controller values. If the values match, then the controller status and
Spare/Protected/Defective values are set from the entry rather than
being generated by the command, and the next entry becomes the current
entry. These values will then be returned to the program as the
completion status of the current command. This process continues until
the table is exhausted or the program ends. The current entry may be
reset to the first entry by specifying the ***SET DS DIAGNOSTIC***
command with no parameters. Entering the ***SET DS NODIAGNOSTIC***
command will clear the table.

If the disc controller command performs address verification, then any
SPD/status value(s) provided will be used as the result of the
verification. In particular, setting the P bit for a Write command will
cause a Protected Track error if the drive's Format switch is set to
*Disabled*, and any status value other than Normal Completion,
Correctable Data Error, or Uncorrectable Data Error will cause a
verification abort.

In hardware, the errors that may occur during verification are Cylinder
Miscompare, Head-Sector Miscompare, Sync Timeout, Illegal Spare Access,
and Defective Track; any of these errors may be simulated. In addition,
an Uncorrectable Data Error will occur in hardware if the controller is
unable to verify any of the 16 sectors starting at the sector preceding
the target sector, but this error cannot be simulated. Instead,
specifying either a Correctable Data Error or an Uncorrectable Data
Error will cause an abort at the end of the first sector of a Read,
Write, or Verify command.

Correctable Data Error and Uncorrectable Data Error may also be
specified for the Request Syndrome command. The former requires the
values to be returned for the displacement and three syndrome words; the
latter does not, as the values are meaningless if the error cannot be
corrected.

### BOOT Command

The interface supports the ***BOOT*** command as an alternative to
***LOAD***. The ***BOOT DS0*** command is equivalent in hardware to
setting the SWCH register to configure the control byte and device
number, and pressing the LOAD and ENABLE buttons to begin the cold load
process for unit 0. The SWCH register is set as follows:

|***0***  | ***1*** |  ***2***|  ***3***|  ***4***| ***5*** | ***6*** | ***7*** |  ***8***   ---  ***15*** |
|---------| --------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------------------------|
|0        | 0       |  0      |   0     |    0    |     0   |      0  |       0 |  DS device number        |

The control byte defaults to the Cold Load Read disc command.

### Tracing and Registers

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
|**CMD**       | Controller commands executed|
|**INCO**      | Controller command initiations and completions|
|**CSRW**      | Interface control, status, read, and write actions|
|**STATE**     | Controller command state changes executed|
|**SERV**      | Disc unit service events|
|**XFER**      | Data reads and writes|
|**IOBUS**     | I/O bus signals and data words received and returned|

The ***CMD*** option traces the commands executed by the disc
controller. The ***INCO*** option traces the beginning and ending of
commands, including command termination status. The ***CSRW*** option
traces control, status, read, and write commands sent to the interface.
The ***STATE*** option traces the entries into each of the internal
controller execution states. The ***SERV*** option traces disc unit
event service scheduling and entries. The ***XFER*** option traces the
data words read from or written to the disc. The ***IOBUS*** option
traces the signals and data received and returned via the I/O backplane
and interface and via the data, flag, and function buses between the
interface and controller.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

    >>DS   cmd: Unit 0 Seek to cylinder 410 head 2 sector 47
    >>DS  inco: Unit 0 Seek command completed with Normal Completion status
    >>DS  csrw: Control is 004000 (Write)
    >>DS state: Unit 0 Write data phase entered from service
    >>DS  serv: Unit 0 Write data phase delay 1 service scheduled
    >>DS  xfer: Unit 0 Write word 3400 is 177777
    >>DS iobus: Received data 005000 with signals PCONTSTB
    >>DS iobus: Controller (idle) received data 005000 with flags CMRDY | EOD

# Multiplexer Channel I/O Device Simulations

The Multiplexer Channel controls these I/O device interfaces:

-   30209A Line Printer Controller
-   30215A Tape Controller

## 30209A Line Printer Controller with One 2607/13/17/18 Line Printer

The HP 30118A, 30127A, 30128A, and 30133A Line Printer Subsystems
connect the 2607A, 2613A, 2618A, and 2617A printers, respectively, to
the HP 3000. Each subsystem consists of a 30209A Line Printer
Controller, employing a 30051A Universal Interface (Differential) and an
interconnecting cable, and an HP 2607A (200 lines per minute), HP 2613
(300 lpm), HP 2617 (600 lpm), or HP 2618 (1250 lpm) line printer. These
subsystems employ the Multiplexer Channel to achieve a 360 KB/second
transfer rate from the CPU.

The simulation provides one printer unit. The 2617 is selected by
default. Attaching a text file to the unit simulates loading paper into
the printer:

    ATTACH {-N} LP <image-filename>

Adding the ***--N*** (new file) switch clears the contents of the image
file if present. Without the ***--N*** switch, printer output will be
appended to any preexisting image file content.

Printer output written to the image file is typically buffered by the
host operating system's underlying stream I/O routines. While it is
running, the simulator flushes the file after each printer top-of-form
request to permit convenient inspection of the image file. Stopping the
simulator also flushes the file.

If the host operating system returns an error when writing to the
printer image file, the simulator will report the error to the
simulation console, e.g.:

    HP 3000 simulator printer I/O error: No space left on device

The printer goes offline with an alarm condition, and the simulator
stops. Simulation may then be resumed, either with the printer set back
online if the problem is fixed, or with the printer remaining offline if
the problem is uncorrectable.

Detaching the text file from the unit with the ***DETACH LP*** command
simulates running out of paper. If the command is entered while there
are characters in the print buffer or, for the 2607 only, the print
location is not at the top of the form, **Command not completed** is
displayed on the simulation console, and the file remains attached until
the required conditions are true. Once simulation is resumed and the
print operations complete, the printer is set offline and detached
automatically.

Detaching may also be forced with the ***DETACH --F LP*** command. This
simulates physically removing the paper and takes effect immediately,
regardless of any printing operations in progress.

Device and unit options include configuring the printer type and timing,
output format, vertical format unit (VFU), and the ability to set the
printer offline or online. The command forms are:

    SET LP <device-option>
    SET LP <unit-option>

### Device Options

Device options that may be specified are:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| ---------------------------------------------------|
|**FASTTIME**          | Use optimized timing; default|
|**REALTIME**          | Use realistic timing|
|**PRINTER**           | Connect using the printer interface cable; default|
|**DIAGNOSTIC**        | Connect using the Diagnostic Hardware Assembly|
|**DEVNO=\<n\>**       | Set the device number; default is 14|
|**INTMASK=\<n\>**     | Set the interrupt mask; default is E|
|**INTPRI=\<n\>**      | Set the interrupt priority; default is 18|
|**SRNO=\<n\>**        | Set the service request number; default is 11|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|
|**ENABLED**           | Enable the device; default|
|**DISABLED**          | Disable the device|

The printer supports realistic and optimized timing modes. Realistic
timing attempts to model the print buffer load and print-and-space
operation delays inherent in the physical hardware. For example, output
of lines with more characters takes longer than output of lines with
fewer characters, and spacing six lines takes approximately six times
longer than spacing one line.

Optimized timing reduces operation delays to the minimums necessary to
operate correctly; this is much faster than a real line printer would
operate.

The delays used by the simulation in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set via
the register interface. The values may be adjusted as necessary to work
around any HP 3000 software problems that are triggered by the unusually
rapid print operations. Resetting the device with the ***RESET --P***
(power-on reset) command restores the original optimized times.

The ***DIAGNOSTIC*** option simulates the installation of the HP 30049C
Diagnostic Hardware Assembly in place of the printer interface cable.
This is needed to run the offline universal interface diagnostic
(program D435A). The CNLED register provides the state of the *CONT 6*
through *CONT 10* LEDs, and the J2WX, DATOUT, DCOUT, DFIN, and DENDIN
registers provide the logic levels of the corresponding test pins on the
DHA.

Setting the ***PRINTER*** option reconnects the cable between the line
printer and the interface.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

|***Command***      | ***Action***|
|-------------------| ------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW LP**        | Display the device and unit configuration|
|**SHOW LP MODES**  | Display the timing and connection modes|

### Unit Options

Unit options that may be specified are:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------|
|**2607**              | Set the printer model to 2607|
|**2613**              | Set the printer model to 2613|
|**2617**              | Set the printer model to 2617; default|
|**2618**              | Set the printer model to 2618|
|**VFU**               | Install the HP standard 66-line VFU tape; default|
|**VFU=\<filename\>**  | Install a custom VFU tape image|
|**OFFLINE**           | Set the printer offline; default when detached|
|**ONLINE**            | Set the printer online; default when attached|
|**EXPAND**            | Write expanded output to the printer image file; default|
|**COMPACT**           | Write compact output to the printer image file|

The ***2607***, ***2613***, ***2617***, and ***2618*** options select
the printer model. Each printer is configured with Option 001, which
provides a 128-character set for the HP 2607 and 96-character sets for
the HP 2613, 2617, and 2618. The 2607 and 2618 support 132-character
print line lengths, while the 2613 and 2617 support 136-character lines.
Exceeding the line length on the 2607 causes an automatic
print-and-space operation. Exceeding the line length on the 2613, 2617,
or 2618 discards the excess characters.

The ***VFU*** option configures the printer's vertical format unit, as
described in the Vertical Format Unit section below.

The ***OFFLINE*** and ***ONLINE*** options place the printer offline and
online, respectively. The former provides a convenient method of setting
the printer \"down\" without detaching the associated output file.

The printer will not go offline if there are characters in the print
buffer. Instead, the offline condition is held off until the line is
printed and paper movement is complete. The ***SET LP OFFLINE*** command
checks for data in the print buffer or a print operation in progress. If
either condition is true, the action is deferred, and **Command not
completed** is displayed on the simulation console. A ***SHOW LP***
command will show that the device is still online. Once simulation is
resumed and the print operation completes, the printer is set offline.
No console message reports this, although a subsequent ***SHOW LP***
command will indicate the new status.

Entering a ***SET LP ONLINE*** command while an offline or detach action
is deferred will cancel the action without triggering any programmed
online-to-offline or offline-to-online status transition interrupt. A
***RESET LP*** command also cancels any deferred offline or detach
action. Additionally, it clears the print buffer and terminates any
print action in progress, so a ***SET LP OFFLINE*** or ***DETACH LP***
will succeed if issued afterward.

The ***EXPAND*** and ***COMPACT*** options control the format of lines
written to the printer image file. In compact mode, a
carriage-return/line-feed character pair terminates a printed line, but
subsequent line spacing is performed by line-feed characters alone. A
top-of-form request will emit a form-feed character instead of the
number of line-feeds required to reach the top of the next form. This
mode is suitable for sending the printer output to a physical printer
connected to the host.

In expanded mode, paper advance is handled by emitting the correct
number of carriage-return/line-feed pairs. This mode is suitable for
retaining printer output as a text file.

The HP 2613, 2617, and 2618 printers are capable of overprinting. If the
printer is sent a format code to suppress spacing, the characters in the
buffer are printed and the buffer is emptied, but the paper is not
advanced. The next print operation will print its characters over those
already present on the paper. In simulation, overprinting is performed
in one of two ways, depending on the print mode.

In compact mode, overprinting is simulated by emitting a carriage-return
character at the end of the line. In expanded mode, overprinting is
simulated by merging characters in the buffer before writing them as a
single line in the printer image file. As the second and subsequent
lines are output, each new character is compared with its corresponding
character in the buffer. If the character in the buffer is a space, the
new character replaces it. If the new character is a space or is the
same as the character in the buffer, the character in the buffer is
retained. Otherwise, the character in the buffer is replaced with a
special character representing an overprinted combination. This
character defaults to DEL (octal 177) but may be changed by altering the
OVPCHR register value.

The HP 2607 printer cannot overprint. A request to suppress spacing will
result in a single-line paper advance after printing.

### Vertical Format Unit

The HP 2607 supports an 8-channel vertical format unit (VFU), and the HP
2613, 2617, and 2618 printers support 12-channel VFUs. A continuous
punched paper tape that controls paper spacing is installed in the VFU
reader. The printer may be commanded to advance the paper until a
punched hole is detected in a specified VFU channel. The length of the
tape establishes the length of the forms loaded into the printer.

Initially, the standard VFU tape (part number 1535-2655 for the HP 2607
or 02613-80001 for the HP 2613, 2617, and 2618) is installed. This tape
associates channels 1-8 with the following printer actions:

|***Channel***  | ***Printer Advances to***|
|---------------| --------------------------|
|**1**          | Top of form|
|**2**          | Bottom of form|
|**3**          | Next single space|
|**4**          | Next double space|
|**5**          | Next triple space|
|**6**          | Next half-page|
|**7**          | Next quarter-page|
|**8**          | Next sixth-page|

For the 02613-80001 tape, channel 9 is punched the same as channel 2,
and channels 10-12 are uncommitted.

The simulator supports the use of custom VFU tape images. A custom tape
may be installed in place of the standard tape by issuing the ***SET LP
VFU=\<filename\>*** command. Custom tapes must reserve channel 1 for the
top-of-form location, but the other channels may be defined as desired.

A custom tape image is a plain-text file that starts with a VFU
definition line and then contains one channel-definition line for each
line of the form. The number of channel-definition lines establishes the
form length.

A semicolon appearing anywhere on a line begins a comment, and the
semicolon and all following characters are ignored. Zero-length lines,
including lines beginning with a semicolon, are ignored. Note that a
line containing one or more blanks is not a zero-length line, so, for
example, the line " *; a comment starting in column 2*" is not ignored.

The first (non-ignored) line in the file must be a VFU definition line
of this exact form:

    VFU=<punch characters>,<no-punch character>{,<title>}

...where:

-   ***punch characters*** is a set of one or more characters used
    interchangeably to represent a punched location.

-   ***no-punch character*** is a single character representing a
    non-punched location.

-   ***title*** is an optional description that is printed by the
    ***SHOW LP VFU*** command; the description "Custom VFU" is used if
    the title is omitted.

If the ***VFU*** line is missing or not of the correct form, then
**Format error** is displayed on the simulation console, and the VFU
tape is not changed.

The remaining lines define the channels punched for each line of the
printed form. The line format consists of a sequence of punch, no-punch,
and "other" characters, in channel order. Each punch or no-punch
character defines a channel state, starting with channel 1 and
proceeding left-to-right until all channels for the VFU are defined; any
the extra channel states on the line are ignored. If the line terminates
before all channels are defined, the remaining channels are set to the
no-punch state. Any \"other\" characters, i.e., neither punch characters
nor no-punch characters, are ignored and may be used freely to delineate
the tape channels.

For a standard 66-line form, the first printable line (form line 1) is
paper line 4, and the last printable line (form line 60) is paper line
63. The first channel-definition line in the file specifies form line 1,
i.e., the top of the form, and must have a punch in channel 1. Channel
line 60 defines form line 60, i.e., the bottom of the form. Six more
channel lines follow: three for the bottom margin, and three for the top
margin of the next form.

An example custom VFU file using a 66-line tape definition for an
8-channel VFU is:

    ; the VFU definition
    ;
    ; the set of punch characters is "1" and "X"
    ; the no-punch character is "0"
    ; all other characters are ignored
    
    VFU=1X,0,A binary tape image
    
    ; the channel definitions
    
    1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 ; top of form (line 1; must have a punch in channel 1)
    0-0-X-0-0-0-0-0 ; single space (line 2)
    0011 ; channels 5-8 default to no-punch (line 3)
    [...]
    0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 ; bottom of form (line 60)
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; bottom form margin (line 61)
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; bottom form margin (line 62)
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; bottom form margin (line 63)
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; top of form margin (line 64)
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; top of form margin (line 65)
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; top of form margin (line 66)

If a custom tape has been used, the standard tape may be reinstalled by
issuing the ***SET LP VFU*** command.

Attempting to command an advance to a channel that is not punched will
cause a tape fault, and the printer will go offline. Setting the printer
back online will clear the fault.

The current VFU definition may be displayed with the following command:

|***Command***    | ***Action***|
|-----------------| -------------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW LP VFU**  | Display the currently loaded VFU tape definition|

This command displays the current VFU tape title and then the channel
definitions for each form line. By default, a punched channel is
indicated by an "O" character, and an unpunched channel is indicated by
a period ("."). These characters may be changed by depositing new values
into the PUNCHR and UNPCHR registers, respectively.

### Tracing and Registers

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -------------------------------------------------------|
|**CMD**       | Printer commands executed|
|**CSRW**      | Interface control, status, read, and write actions|
|**SERV**      | Printer, pulse, and transfer timer unit service events|
|**XFER**      | Data transmissions|
|**STATE**     | Device handshake state changes executed|
|**IOBUS**     | I/O bus signals and data words received and returned|

The ***CMD*** option traces the commands executed by the printer. The
***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands sent
to the interface. The ***SERV*** option traces printer and interface
unit event service entries. The ***XFER*** option traces the data words
and format commands written to the printer. The ***STATE*** option
traces the scheduling of and entries into each of the internal device
handshake execution states. The ***IOBUS*** option traces the signals
and data received and returned via the I/O backplane.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

    >>LP   cmd: Printed 132 characters on line 8
    >>LP   cmd: Printer commanded to slew to VFU channel 1 from line 9
    >>LP   cmd: Printer advanced 58 lines to line 1
    >>LP  csrw: Control is character | interrupt status | word xfer
    >>LP  csrw: Status is DIO OK | interrupt | interrupt status | system
    >>LP  serv: Transfer delay 1491 service scheduled
    >>LP  serv: Device Command 1 state printer service entered
    >>LP  xfer: Character 'M' sent to printer
    >>LP  xfer: Format code 001 sent to printer
    >>LP state: Sequencer transitioned from Idle state to Device Flag 1 state
    >>LP iobus: Received data 046515 with signals ACKSR | PWRITESTB | CHANSO
    >>LP iobus: Returned data 060004 with signals INTREQ | JMPMET

The Line Printer Controller state contains these registers:

|***Name***            | ***Size*** |  ***Radix***|   ***Symbolic***|   ***Read-Only***|   ***Description***|
|----------------------| -----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|

The PRTBUF, OVPCHR, PUNCHR, and UNPCHR registers default to
single-character format display and entry but may be overridden with
numeric-format switches, if desired. The READ, WRITE, DATOUT, and DATIN
registers default to octal display but may be displayed in
single-character format by specifying the ***--A*** switch. Symbolic
entry for these registers is also supported.

The PFAULT and TFAULT registers indicate a paper fault and a tape fault,
respectively, when they contain the value 1. Attaching the printer will
clear a paper fault. Setting the printer online will clear a tape fault.

The character used to represent an overprinted position may be changed
by depositing a new value into the OVPCHR register. For example, the
***DEPOSIT LP OVPCHR @*** command will change the character from the
default DEL (octal 177) to the commercial-at sign (octal 100).
Similarly, the characters used to represent punched and unpunched VFU
channels in the ***SHOW LP VFU*** display may be changed by depositing
new values in the PUNCHR and UNPCHR registers, respectively.

The FORMLN register holds the current VFU form length, and the VFU
register array holds the content of the current VFU tape. The register
defaults to binary display, with channel 1 in the most-significant bit
and channel 8 or 12 in the least-significant bit, depending on the VFU
width. Elements 1-n correspond to VFU form lines 1-n, where a 1 value
indicates a punch, and a 0 value indicates a no-punch. Element 0 is the
logical OR of elements 1-n, so a 1 value indicates that the channel is
punched somewhere on the tape, and a 0 value indicates that the channel
is not punched.

## 30215A Tape Controller with Four 7970B/E Drives

The HP 30115A Magnetic Tape Subsystem connects the 7970B/E ½-inch
magnetic tape drives to the HP 3000. The subsystem consists of a 30215A
two-card tape controller processor and controller interface, and from
one to four HP 7970B 800-bpi NRZI or HP 7970E 1600-bpi PE drives. The
two drive types may be mixed on a single controller. The subsystem uses
the Multiplexer Channel to achieve a 36 KB/second (NRZI) or 72 KB/second
(PE) transfer rate to the CPU.

The simulation provides up to four tape drives. 7970Es are selected by
default. Attaching a tape image file to a unit simulates mounting a tape
reel on a drive:

    ATTACH {-R} {-F} MSn {<format>} <image-filename>

Adding the ***--R*** (read-only) switch is equivalent to mounting the
tape without a write ring in place. Adding the ***--F*** switch and a
format identifier declares the tape image format to be used. Supported
formats are ***SIMH***, ***E11***, ***TPC***, and ***P7B***. If the
***--F*** switch and a format identifier are not supplied, then SIMH
tape image format is used. Note that erase gaps embedded in the tape
image file are supported only in SIMH image format mode.

If the host operating system returns an error when reading or writing a
tape image file, the simulator will report the error to the simulation
console, e.g.:

    HP 3000 simulator tape library I/O error: No space left on device

If this or another tape library error occurs, e.g., due to an illegal or
damaged tape format, the simulator stops with an appropriate error
message. Resuming the simulation will fail the tape operation with Tape
Error status. The target operating system will then react to this error
as though a real drive had encountered a bad tape block (CRC or MTE).

A drive's unit number is not set explicitly. Instead, the drive unit
number is derived from the simulation unit number. For example, unit MS0
responds to tape unit select number 0. Pressing a different unit select
button on a mounted drive is equivalent to detaching and reattaching the
tape image file to the corresponding simulation unit. Pressing the OFF
button is equivalent to setting the drive offline.

Device and unit options include configuring the drive type and timing,
tape reel size, tape image format, and the ability to set drives offline
or online. The command forms are:

    SET MS <device-option>
    SET MSn <unit-option>

### Device Options

Device options that may be specified are:

|***Option***          | ***Action***|
|----------------------| ---------------------------------------------|
|**FASTTIME**          | Use optimized timing; default|
|**REALTIME**          | Use realistic timing|
|**DEVNO=\<n\>**       | Set the device number; default is 6|
|**INTMASK=\<n\>**     | Set the interrupt mask; default is E|
|**INTPRI=\<n\>**      | Set the interrupt priority; default is 14|
|**SRNO=\<n\>**        | Set the service request number; default is 3|
|**DEBUG=\<option\>**  | Enable tracing|
|**NODEBUG**           | Disable tracing; default|
|**ENABLED**           | Enable the device; default|
|**DISABLED**          | Disable the device|

When realistic timing is enabled, the simulation accurately models the
tape movement times (in machine instructions). For example, rewinding
takes longer if the tape is positioned farther from the load point.
Realistic timing is necessary to pass the magnetic tape diagnostic
timing tests.

Optimized timing reduces the timing to the minimum necessary to operate
correctly; this is much faster than a real tape drive would operate. In
addition, enabling optimized timing also omits the initial erase gap
normally written after the BOT marker. This does not affect gaps written
with the Write Gap command.

The delay times used by the simulation in ***FASTTIME*** mode may be set
via the register interface. The values may be adjusted as necessary to
work around any HP 3000 software problems that are triggered by the
unusually rapid tape operation. Resetting the device with the ***RESET
--P*** (power-on reset) command restores the original optimized times.

Device configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

|***Command***       | ***Action***|
|--------------------| ------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW MS**         | Display the device and unit configuration|
|**SHOW MS TIMING**  | Display the timing mode|

### Unit Options

Unit options that may be specified for individual tape drives are:

|***Option***        | ***Action***|
|--------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------|
|**7970B**           | Set the drive type to 7970B|
|**7970E**           | Set the drive type to 7970E; default|
|**REEL=\<n\>**      | Set the reel size in feet; default is unlimited|
|**CAPACITY=\<n\>**  | Set the reel capacity in megabytes; default is unlimited|
|**OFFLINE**         | Set the unit offline; default when detached|
|**ONLINE**          | Set the unit online; default when attached|
|**FORMAT=\<fmt\>**  | Set the tape image format; default is SIMH format|
|**ENABLED**         | Enable the unit; default|
|**DISABLED**        | Disable the unit|

The reel size may be set to 600-, 1200-, or 2400-foot capacity. Setting
the capacity or reel size to 0 specifies unlimited capacity; in this
configuration, the controller never returns an end-of-tape indication.

The ***OFFLINE*** and ***ONLINE*** options place a drive offline and
online, respectively. The former provides a convenient method of setting
a drive \"down\" without detaching the associated tape image file.

The tape image format for future ***ATTACH*** commands may be set to one
of the format identifiers listed previously. The unit must be detached
when the format is set.

Drive configuration may be displayed with the following commands:

|***Command***              | ***Action***|
|---------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------|
|**SHOW MS\<n\>**           | Display the selected drive's configuration|
|**SHOW MS\<n\> REEL**      | Display the selected drive's reel size or capacity|
|**SHOW MS\<n\> CAPACITY**  | Display the selected drive's reel size or capacity|
|**SHOW MS\<n\> FORMAT**    | Display the selected drive's tape image format|

### BOOT Command

The interface supports the ***BOOT*** command as an alternative to
***LOAD***. The ***BOOT MS0*** command is equivalent in hardware to
setting the SWCH register to configure the control byte and device
number, and pressing the LOAD and ENABLE buttons to begin the cold load
process for unit 0. The SWCH register is set as follows:

| ***0*** | ***1*** | ***2*** | ***3*** | ***4*** | ***5*** | ***6*** | ***7*** | ***8*** ---  ***15*** |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
|0        | 0       |  0      |   0     |    0    |     1   |      1  |       0 |        MS device      |

The control byte defaults to the Read Record tape command.

### Tracing and Registers

When debug output logging is enabled, tracing may be configured by
specifying one or more of the reporting level options:

|***Option***  | ***Reporting Level***|
|--------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
|**CMD**       | Controller commands executed|
|**INCO**      | Controller command initiations and completions|
|**CSRW**      | Interface control, status, read, and write actions|
|**STATE**     | Controller command state changes executed|
|**SERV**      | Tape unit service events|
|**XFER**      | Data reads and writes|
|**IOBUS**     | I/O bus signals and data words received and returned|

The ***CMD*** option traces the commands executed by the tape
controller. The ***INCO*** option traces the beginning and ending of
commands, including the starting and ending tape position. The
***CSRW*** option traces control, status, read, and write commands sent
to the interface. The ***STATE*** option traces the scheduling of and
entries into each of the internal controller execution states. The
***SERV*** option traces tape unit event service entries. The ***XFER***
option traces the data words read from or written to the tape. The
***IOBUS*** option traces the signals and data received and returned via
the I/O backplane and interface and via the data, flag, and function
buses between the interface and controller.

Examples of the trace formats follow:

    >>MS   cmd: Unit 0 Write Record of 20-byte record succeeded
    >>MS  inco: Unit 0 Write Record started at position 6120
    >>MS  csrw: Control is 000005 (Write Gap)
    >>MS  csrw: Status is ready | load point | 1600 bpi | no error | unit 0
    >>MS state: Unit 0 Write Gap start phase delay 3794 service scheduled
    >>MS  serv: Unit 0 service entered
    >>MS  xfer: Unit 0 Write Record word 1 is 052525
    >>MS iobus: Controller (idle) returned data 000000 with functions RQSRV
    >>MS iobus: Received data 125252 with signals ACKSR | PWRITESTB | CHANSO

The Tape Controller state contains these registers:

|***Name***              | ***Size*** |  ***Radix***|   ***Read-Only***|   ***Description***|
|------------------------| -----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
