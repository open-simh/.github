# General Questions

##  What is SIMH?

SIMH is the Computer History Simulation system. It consists of
simulators for approximately 20 different computers, all written around
a common user interface package and set of supporting libraries. SIMH
can be used to simulate any computer system for which sufficient detail
is available, but the focus to date has been on simulating computer
systems of historic interest.

##  Why was SIMH written?

Significant portions of the computing past are being irretrievably lost,
as old systems are scrapped, documentation and software is thrown out,
media become obsolete or unreadable, and inventors and pioneers die.
SIMH was written as a vehicle to allow the computing past to be made
accessible to

a wider audience, for recreational and educational purposes. SIMH
preserves historic computers as portable software that can be run on any
modern system. SIMH also preserves representative software packages for
these systems. With SIMH, anyone with a desktop computer can call up and
run significant samples from the computing past, at any time.

## What is the history of SIMH?

The SIMH project started in 1993, at the suggestion of Larry Stewart of
DEC. Its immediate purpose was to preserve the fading hardware and
software record of early minicomputers. Since then, the project has been
expanded to include other important systems, spanning the history of
computing from the late 50's to the late 80's.

SIMH's core design is based on an earlier simulation system called
MIMIC. MIMIC was written in the late 1960's at Applied Data Research, by
Mike McCarthy, Len Feshkens, and Bob Supnik. MIMIC was a mini-computer
simulator that ran on the PDP-10. Its purpose was to facilitate the
development and debugging of real-time embedded systems by using the
PDP-10 timesharing environment for program development, instead of the
limited facilities of the native minicomputer environments. Ironically,
given SIMH's mission to preserve the computing record, all
machine-readable copies of MIMIC have been lost.

## Who writes and maintains SIMH?

Many people have contributed, and continue to contribute, to SIMH. The
full list of contributors can be found on the SIMH web site. Bob Supnik
coordinates SIMH development.

## How is SIMH licensed?

SIMH is licensed under a modified X-Windows license. This license allows
more or less unrestricted use of the sources and binaries. The license
is included with the documentation and is also included in every source
module. The software packages are available under various terms and
conditions; see the documentation included with each software package.

## How is SIMH distributed?

SIMH is distributed in source form from GitHub in the form of a Zip
archive (<https://github.com/simh/simh/archive/master.zip>) or by
directly accessing the GitHub repository (https://github.com/simh/simh).
For Windows users, pre-compiled binaries are also available
(https://github.com/simh/Win32-Development-Binaries).

## Which computer systems does SIMH simulate?

discussion on the SIMH mailing list.

##  How do I search the simh mailing list archive for questions that might have been asked and answered before?

Google is your friend here. For example:

Perform a Google search for: rsts archive -V9
site:mailman.trailing-edge.com/pipermail/simh/

This finds all messages containint “rsts” “archive” but not “V9”.

# Operational Questions

## How do I install SIMH on Windows?

The simplest way is to download the pre-compiled binaries. Unzip these
into the directory where you want to run SIMH. You can then run
whichever binary that you want.

## How do I install SIMH with Ethernet support on Windows?

The pre-compiled binaries will provide Ethernet support depending on
whether or not the Npcap (or WinPCAP) package has been installed on the
host computer. If you want to run with Ethernet support, you must
download and install the Npcap AutoInstaller from

https://nmap.org/npcap/\#download

This creates a network packet driver in Windows for SIMH to attach to.

To use network support, you must either be an administrator on the
Windows machine (implied in Windows 9X), or you must set the windows
packet driver to autostart when the system boots. The NpcapInstaller has
an option (which defaults to true) which will automatically start the
Network Packet Filter Driver.

## How do I install SIMH on Unix/Linux/OSX?

Ethernet support is available only on Linux, OSX, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
FreeBSD and Solaris.

    > found in the 0readme\_ethernet.txt file in the simh sources.

## How do I install SIMH on VMS?

Download the SIMH source kit, and UNZIP it in the directory that you
want SIMH to reside in. Unpack it and set the file attributes as
follows:

> $ unzip simh-package.zip
> 
> $ set default \[.directory-containing scp.c\]
> 
> $ set file/attri=RFM:STM
> makefile,\*.mms,\[...\]\*.c,\[...\]\*.h,\[...\]\*.txt

Simulators with ethernet network devices (All the VAX simulators and the
PDP11) can have functioning networking when running on Alpha or IA64
OpenVMS. In order to build and run simulators with networking support,
the VMS-PCAP package must be available while building your simulator.
The vms-pcap.zip file can be downloaded from
https://github.com/downloads/simh/simh/vms-pcap.zip. The vms-pcap.zip
file should be unpacked as follows:

> $ unzip –aa vms-pcap.zip

The PCAP-VMS components are presumed (by the descript.mms file) to be
located in a directory at the same level as the directory containing the
simh source files. For example, if these exist here:

> \[\]descrip.mms
> 
> \[\]scp.c
> 
> etc.

Then the following should exist:

> \[-.PCAP-VMS\]BUILD\_ALL.COM
> 
> \[-.PCAP-VMS.PCAP-VCI\]
> 
> \[-.PCAP-VMS.PCAPVCM\]
> 
> etc.

To build simulators:

On a VAX use:

> $ MMx

On a Alpha & IA64 hosts use:

> $ MMx \! With Ethernet support
> 
> $ MMx/MACRO=(“NONETWORK=1) \! Without Ethernet support

UNZIP can be found on the VMS freeware CDs, or from www.info-zip.org

MMS (Module Management System) can be licensed from HP/Compaq/Digital as
part of the VMS Hobbyist program (it is a component of the DECSET
product).

MMK can be found on the VMS freeware CDs, or from
<http://www.kednos.com/kednos/Open_Source/MMK>

DEC C can be licensed from HP/Compaq/Digital as part of the VMS Hobbyist
program.

Note that the PDP-10, I7094 and Eclipse emulators cannot be built and
used on VAX/VMS, because the DEC C compiler for VAX/VMS does not support
64-bit integers. OpenVMS DEC C Alpha and IA64 systems has the required
64-bit capability to build and run all of the emulators. Ethernet
support is only available on Alpha VMS 7.3-1 and above.

## How do I transcribe other archival media for use with SIMH?

You must have access to a real system that can read the media to be
transcribed (e.g., a system with a working DECtape drive to read a
DECtape). Most systems have utilities to copy raw data to a disk file;
that file can then be transferred over the console serial line to a
system with an Internet link. Utility programs are available to convert
raw data streams to SIMH format.

## How can I get text files in and out of SIMH?

### Tape input

Files coming into a simulated system can easily be achieved by using a
simulated tape drive. This mechanism allows local host system files to
be presented to the simulated system as a set of files on an ANSI
labeled tape. If the simulated system’s operating system knows how to
read ANSI labeled tape this is a good choice.

> 
> %MOUNT-I-WRITELOCK, volume is write locked
> 
> %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, SIMH mounted on \_MSA0:
> 
> $ TYPE MSA0:file.txt

### Serial input and output

Since SIMH supports the universal serial interface using TELNET, text
can be transferred using one of the serial line transfer protocols
(X/Y/Zmodem, Kermit) or using standard cut and paste techniques, if the
host's TELNET program supports it.

To use the TELNET feature, connect to the SIMH machine using TELNET, and
set the target environment into a 'receive' mode. This is usually
something like running a text editor. Then tell the TELNET program to
'send', 'transfer', or 'paste' the text that you want sent into the SIMH
system.

To get text out of the system, have the TELNET program either log the
output, or if the TELNET program supports a backscroll region you can
use that. Tell the SIMH system to 'type' or 'cat' the text file, sending
the output to the TELNET device, where you can edit it into a text file.

Many TELNET programs also support transferring large files via
X/Y/ZModem or Kermit, which you can use as long as the SIMH system has
the appropriate matching program.

C-Kermit from Columbia University (http://www.columbia.edu/kermit) is
probably the most universal way to transfer files in and out of SIMH
systems.

### Paper Tape input and output

Some systems have paper tape devices which can be attached to a file on
the host system and be read within the simulated system. Systems with a
paper tape reader also have a paper tape punch which can be used for
output.

### Ethernet input and output

If the SIMH system supports Ethernet connectivity (PDP-11, VAX), you can
also use the various network copy programs (FTP, DECNET) to transfer
files.

### Printer output

Finally, you can "print" text files to the simulated line printer.
Printer output is automatically formatted as an ASCII text file.

## How can I get binary files in and out of SIMH?

### Serial input and output

Since SIMH supports the universal serial interface using TELNET, binary
files can be transferred using one of the serial line transfer protocols
(X/Y/ZModem, Kermit) or by converting the binary to a text-encoded file

(HEXify, UUENCODE, VMShare, etc.) and transferred in text mode (see
section 2.7).

Many TELNET programs also support transferring large files via
X/Y/ZModem or Kermit, which you can use as long as the SIMH system has
the appropriate matching program.

C-Kermit from Columbia University (http://www.columbia.edu/kermit) is
probably the most universal way to transfer files in and out of SIMH
systems.

### Ethernet input and output

If the SIMH system supports Ethernet connectivity (PDP-11, VAX), you can
also use the various network copy programs (FTP, DECNET) to transfer
files.

## Can I connect real devices on the host computer to SIMH?

Currently Ethernet devices, Serial Ports and physical disks and/or
CDROMs are the devices which can be accessed directly from simh
simulators.

## My Windows host can't communicate with the PDP-11 or VAX over Ethernet; why?

Current versions of the simulators will directly allow you to
communicate with both other systems on your LAN and your host computer
by attaching the simulator’s XQ device to the primary network interface
on your host.

## My Linux, OSX or other Unix host can't communicate with the PDP-11 or VAX over Ethernet; why?

The network stacks on these systems don’t naturally receive packets
which are transmitted with the pcap\_sendpacket API. This issue can be
accommodated in one of four ways:

1)  Use NAT mode for your network connection. This mode only allows
    TCP/IP traffic to flow between the systems (No DECnet, LAT or other
    proprietary LAN protocols), which will be fine for single simulator
    situations.

2)  add a second Ethernet controller, attach both controllers to the
    same switch or hub, and attach SIMH to the second controller. Don’t
    configure any host network protocols on the second Ethernet
    controller. The host and SIMH will now be able to communicate across
    the physical network connection

3)  If the host has internal (kernel level) network bridging support,
    then the host’s network configuration can be setup to allow direct
    communication between the host and the simulated system. The simh
    networking layer can accommodate tun/tap and/or vde networking to
    achieve this. Details of how this is done and which hosts it can
    work on can be found in the 0readme\_ethernet.txt file in the simh
    zip file.

4)  Enable 2 XQ (or XU) devices in the simulator and use one in NAT mode
    to talk to the host system and connect the other to LAN for
    simulator to simulator communications and other LAN protocols.

## How can I use my wireless Ethernet card with SIMH?

The best approach here is to use NAT mode on your network connection.
This will work fine for simulators using TCP/IP to talk to either their
host system and/or to reach the Internet. Meanwhile, as for directly
using the wireless network card the following are some of the
considerations:

Wireless Ethernet is something of a misnomer - it "works like" Ethernet.
Wireless cards behave differently than real Ethernet cards in
promiscuous mode. Some wireless cards can’t operate in promiscuous mode
but can sometimes be successfully used with existing SIMH code.
Sometimes this will also depend on functionality provided by the
wireless router you may be connected to. Many wireless routers will not
be well behaved when you attempt this.

One of the caveats is that the simulated machine cannot run any software
which changes the simulated MAC address, or the network connection will
stop working. For example, DECNET Phase IV (or Phase V in compatibility
mode) tries to change the MAC of the network card to AA-00-04-xx-xx-xx.
Nor can you preset the wireless MAC address to the anticipated target
DECNET address using something like SMAC to get DECNET to work - DECNET
will see the MAC already preset to the required DECNET address and
generate an invalid media (duplicate address) fault.

Otherwise, TCP/IP, LAT, VMS Clustering, and DECNET Phase V in
non-compatibility mode work fine.

To get wireless cards to work with SIMH, set the simulated MAC to be the
same as the MAC of the wireless card. An example:

## Why doesn’t simh idling work on my Unix host?

Some host systems have default clock tick sizes which are greater than
what is required to produce useful simh idling behavior.Useful Idling
depends on a simulators ability to sleep for intervals which are less
than or equal to the simulated system’s clock tick. Best idling behavior
is realized when sleep intervals can be as small as 1ms. When a
simulator starts, simh determines the host system’s clock tick size and
based on this determination, idling will be supported or not. The SHOW
VERSION command will display (among other things) the .host OS’s clock
tick size which simh has determined. On some platforms (Windows), the
host system’s clock tick size can be dynamically changed by
non-privileged user mode code. On Windows systems, simh sets the OS
clock tick size to 1ms so that idling can be supported. Changing the OS
tick size on other platforms may be achieved in some system specific
way.

On Solaris, the file /etc/system contains parameters used to adjust
various operating system details. Adding the following lines to this
file and rebooting the system will set the OS clock tick to 1ms and simh
will have idling support:

set hires\_tick=1

set hires\_hz=1000

# Writing and Debugging New Code

## What resources are available for writing new simulators?

The SIMH web site contains documentation on the internals of SIMH, as
well as specific help for writing new peripherals for several of the
popular simulators. The doc directory in the github simh source code has
a file doc/simh.doc which describes the internal APIs used by simulator
writers.

## What debugging facilities are available in SIMH?

Most simulators provide the following debugging capabilities:

  - Symbolic assembly and disassembly of memory contents.

  - Numeric examination and modification of the data store of any
    simulated device.

  - Numeric search on both memory and device data.

  - Visibility to simulator internal structures, such as the event
    queue.

  - An unlimited number of instruction breakpoints.

  - Proceed counts on breakpoints.

  - Automatic execution of simulator commands on a breakpoint.

  - Stepped execution (from single step to 'n' steps).

  - A PC change queue, usually 64 instructions deep.

  - Instruction execution history recording and display.

Specific simulators may provide additional features, such as an
instruction history buffer, CPU and/or device logging, and breakpoints
on memory reads and writes.

## When do I need to use the host debugger for debugging a simulator?

While a simulator is being debugged, its execution of instructions or
debugging support code may be unreliable. During this process, the
programmer may need to use the host debugger to stop in the middle of an
instruction execution, or to trap an error condition. Host debugger
breakpoints should be invisible to the simulator; with the exception of
clock calibration, all simulator events are driven off the event queue
rather than real-world events.

If the programmer needs to force a simulator stop from the host
debugger, most simulators provide an "address stop" global variable.
Setting this variable to 1 will cause the simulator to stop after
completing the current instruction.

## What is the release process for SIMH?

The latest development code is available on the public source code
repository at <https://github.com/simh/simh/archive/master.zip>. Since
the latest code is always publicly available and bugs are generally
fixed somewhat quickly, there hasn’t been a driving need for formal
releases.

Bob Supnik’s original development efforts are tracked in the
Supnik-Current branch of the github repository. Any changes that he
makes there are merged directly into the master branch whenever he
provides his current state.

Bob’s original development activites released new versions of SIMH
whenever a significant number of new features, or important bug fixes,
has accumulated. The major version number only changes when there is a
major restructuring of SIMH's internal structures. The minor version
number is changed when the format of the save/restore file must be
updated.

# VAX

## Where can I get software and hobbyist licenses for the VAX?

HP (formerly Compaq formerly DEC) provides licenses to OpenVMS for
hobbyist use. A description of the hobbyist license program can be found
on http://www.openvmshobbyist.com.

## How do I install VMS?

To install VMS, you will need a distribution CD ROM. Any version after
VMS 5.5-2 should run on the MicroVAX 3900 simulator.

  - Transcribe the distribution CD ROM to an ISO-format CD image file.
    (See question 2.5 for information on how to do this.)

  - Set drive RQ1 to be a CD ROM.

  - Attach the CD ROM image file to simulated drive RQ1.

  - Set drive RQ0 to be the type of disk you want. Be sure that the disk
    is large enough to hold VMS.

  - Attach a blank disk image file to simulated drive RQ0.

  - Boot the CPU.

  - When the self-test code completes, boot the CD ROM.

  - Use standalone backup to restore the CD ROM contents to the
    simulated disk.

sim\> set rq0 rd54

sim\> set rq1 cdrom

sim\> att rq0 new\_vms.dsk

sim\> att rq1 cd\_rom\_image.iso

sim\> boot cpu

:

\>\>\> boot rq1

$ (prompt from standalone backup)

A writeup on the procedure can be found on the VMS hobbyist site.

## How do I install NetBSD?

Directions for installing NetBSD on the NetBSD web site, at
http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/vax/emulator-howto.html.

## How do I install Ultrix?

Ultrix is not presently licensed for hobbyist use. If you have a valid
license for Ultrix, and distribution tapes for a version that supports
the MicroVAX 3900 series (V4 or later), then you should be able to
install Ultrix on the simulator.

  - > Transcribe the distribution tapes to SIMH-format tape image files.
    > (See question 2.6 for information on how to do this.)

  - > Mount the installation tape image on simulated drive TQ0.

  - > Set drive RQ0 to be the type of disk you want. Be sure that the
    > disk is large enough to hold Ultrix.

  - > Mount a blank disk image file on simulated drive RQ0.

  - > Boot the CPU.

  - > When the self-test code completes, boot the installation tape.

  - > The installation tape will guide you through the installation of
    > Ultrix.

## What's the CPU serial number for my hobbyist license PAK?

On a MicroVAX 3900, the CPU serial number is not readable and can be an
arbitrary value. 12345 will work fine.

## How do I import and make my hobbyist license PAKs usable?

See [How can I import files to a simulated VMS
environment?](#how-can-i-import-files-to-a-simulated-vms-environment)
and [How do I make imported files readable on a simulated VMS
system?](#how-do-i-make-imported-files-readable-on-a-simulated-vms-system)

## How do I change the simulator from a VAXserver 3900 to a MicroVAX 3900?

To change the type between a MicroVAX 3900 and a VAXServer 3900 use the
following commands:

> sim\> set cpu model=VAXServer
> 
> sim\> set cpu model=MicroVAX

and boot the simulated VAX.

## Is there an example of the simulator running VMS?

This example assumes you are trying to emulate a MicroVAX 3900 with 64MB
of memory, with a single 1GB disk drive, a CDROM, and an Ethernet
controller.

The host OS is Windows NT/2000/XP, and you have previously dumped the
contents of the VMS Hobbyist CD to a disk file as detailed in 2.5, and
have loaded npcap/WinPCAP on the system for Ethernet support. Other host
OS's will look similar but will have different file name syntax.

## How can I import files to a simulated VMS environment?

### The Easy Way

  - Present the files to the VMS system using a pseudo tape drive with
    the ANSIFILES tape format.

> This approach is both easy and achieves direct access by the VMS
> system in a single step.
> 
> c:\\simh\> vax ; run VAX emulator
> 
> sim\> attach ts0 –f ansi-vms Hobbyist-USE-ONLY-VA.TXT,\*.exe,
> 
> within the running simulator:
> 
> $ mount MSA0: SIMH
> 
> %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, SIMH mounted on \_MSA0:
> 
> $ @MSA0:Hobbyist-USE-ONLY-VA.TXT

### Alternatively

  - Use a CD burner program, like Easy CD Creator or Nero, to create an
    ISO 9660 CD image containing the files you want to import. Note that
    file names are limited to DOS '8.3' conventions.

  - Attach the simulated CD image to a simulated CD drive.

  - Mount the simulated CD as an ISO 9660 file system under VMS.

  - Copy the files you need from the simulated CD to the simulated disk.

(Thanks to Tim Stark for this suggestion.)

## How do I make imported files readable on a simulated VMS system?

Files imported using the ANSITAPE paradigm are directly usable without
further manipulation.

Some imported files may need to have their file attributes set
appropriately in order to be easily usable in the simulated VMS system.
This may be the case for text files which come from Unix or Windows
systems that have LF or CRLF line endings and may have been transported
to the VMS system via binary network transport OR via a CD image.
DIRECTORY/FULL will display the file’s attributes. A file transferred in
binary mode will likely have record attributes that say: “Fixed 512 byte
records”.

A file’s record attributes can be changed to handle text files with LF
line endings with

$ SET FILE/ATTRIBUTE=RFM:STMLF

A file’s record attributes can be changed to handle text files with CRLF
line endings with:

$ SET FILE/ATTRIBUTE=RFM:STM

This will work with the latest version of VMS, but earlier versions
didn’t have the SET FILE/ATTRIBUTE command.

## How can I export files from a simulated VMS environment?

  - Utility ODS2 (available on the Web) can read an ODS-2 disk image and
    copy files from that image to the host file system.

  - Text files can be printed to the simulated line printer, as
    described above.

## When installing RSTS/E from simulated magnetic tape, the installation process hangs with no error message; why?

RSTS/E installation from magnetic tape requires that the tape be write
locked.
