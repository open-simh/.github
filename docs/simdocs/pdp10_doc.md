The PTR, PTP, RX211, CR, DMR0, DMR1, DMR2 and DMR3 are initially set
DISABLED. The DZ11 and LP20 can also be set DISABLED. Some devices
support the SET \<device\> ADDRESS command, which allows the I/O page
address of the device to be changed, and the SET \<device\> VECTOR
command, which allows the vector of the device to be changed. All
devices support the SHOW \<device\> ADDRESS and SHOW \<device\> VECTOR
commands, which display the device address and vector, respectively.

The PDP-10 simulator implements several unique stop condition:

  - Illegal instruction (000) in kernel mode

  - Indirect addressing nesting exceeds limit (if enabled)

  - Execute chaining exceeds limit (if enabled)

  - Page fail or other error in interrupt sequence

  - Illegal instruction in interrupt sequence

  - Invalid vector pointer in interrupt sequence

  - Invalid Unibus adapter number

  - Non-existent exec or user page table address

The LOAD command supports RIM10B format paper tapes, SAV binary files,
and EXE binary files. LOAD switches -r, -s, -e specify RIM10, SAV, EXE
format, respectively. If no switch is specified, the LOAD command checks
the file extension; .RIM, .SAV, .EXE specify RIM10, SAV, EXE format,
respectively. If no switch is specified, and no extension matches, the
LOAD command checks the file format to try to determine the file type.

## CPU

The CPU options allow the user to specify the operating system to be
run. This in turn controls the microcode feature set, how system idling
is detected, and how the system timer runs.

SET CPU TOPS10 TOPS-10

SET CPU TOPS20 TOPS-20

SET CPU ITS ITS

SET CPU KLAD diagnostic environment (no idle detection)

The CPU implements a SHOW command to display the I/O space address map:

SHOW CPU IOSPACE show I/O space address map

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

name size comments

PC 18 program counter

FLAGS 18 processor flags (\<13:17\> unused)

AC0..AC17 36 active register set

IR 36 instruction register

EBR 18 executive base register

PGON 1 paging enabled flag

T20P 1 TOPS-20 paging

UBR 18 user base register

CURAC 3 current AC block

PRVAC 3 previous AC block

WRU 8 interrupt character

REG\[0:127\] 36 register sets

The CPU attempts to detect when the simulator is idle. When idle, the
simulator does not use any resources on the host system. Idle detection
is controlled by the SET IDLE and SET NOIDLE commands:

SET CPU IDLE enable idle detection

SET CPU NOIDLE disable idle detection

Idle detection is disabled by default and is operating system dependent:

TOPS-10 SOJG 6,1 in AC1 in user mode

TOPS-20 SOJG 2,3 in AC3 in monitor mode

ITS AOJA 0,17 in AC17 in user mode

There is no idle detection in diagnostic mode.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 65536 entries.

## Pager

The pager contains the page maps for executive and user mode. The
executive page map is the memory space for unit 0, the user page map the
memory space for unit 1. A page map entry is 32 bits wide and has the
following format:

bit content

31 page is writeable

30 entry is valid

29:19 mbz

18:9 physical page base address

8:0 mbz

The pager has no registers.

## Unibus Adapters

The Unibus adapters link the system I/O devices to the CPU. Unibus
adapter 1 (UBA1) is unit 0, and Unibus adapter 3 is unit 1. The
adapter's Unibus map is the memory space of the corresponding unit.

The Unibus adapter has the following registers:

name size comments

INTREQ 32 interrupt requests

UB1CS 16 Unibus adapter 1 control/status

UB3CS 16 Unibus adapter 3 control/status

### I/O Device Addressing

Unibus I/O space is not large enough to allow all possible devices to be
configured simultaneously at fixed addresses. Instead, many devices have
floating addresses; that is, the assigned device address depends on the
presence of other devices in the configuration:

PC11 fixed address and vector

CR11 fixed address and vector

DZ11 all instances have floating addresses

DUP11 all instances have floating addresses

RX11/RX211 first instance has fixed address, rest floating

DEUNA/DELUA first instance has fixed address, rest floating

DMR11 all instances have floating addresses

To maintain addressing consistency as the configuration changes, the
simulator implements DEC's standard I/O address and vector
autoconfiguration algorithms for all Unibus devices. This allows the
user to enable or disable devices without needing to manage I/O
addresses and vectors.

In addition to autoconfiguration, most devices support the SET
\<device\> ADDRESS command, which allows the I/O page address of the
device to be changed, and the SET \<device\> VECTOR command, which
allows the vector of the device to be changed. Explicitly setting the
I/O address or vector of a device DISABLES autoconfiguration for that
device and for the entire system. As a consequence, the user may have to
manually configure all other autoconfigured devices, because the
autoconfiguration algorithm no longer recognizes the explicitly
configured device. A device can be reset to autoconfigure with the SET
\<device\> AUTOCONFIGURE command. Autoconfiguration can be restored for
the entire system with the SET UBA AUTOCONFIGURE command.

The current I/O map can be displayed with the SHOW CPU IOSPACE command.
Addresses that have set by autoconfiguration to Unibus floating
addresses or vectors are marked with an asterisk (\*).

All devices support the SHOW \<device\> ADDRESS and SHOW \<device\>
VECTOR commands, which display the device address and vector,
respectively.

## Front End (FE)

The front end is the system console. The keyboard input is unit 0, the
console output is unit 1. It supports one option:

SET FE STOP halt the PDP-10 operating system

The front end also provides the keep-alive and reload request services.

The keep-alive service is used to detect failure of the OS to make
forward progress, and initiates recovery.

The reload request service allows the PDP-10 operating system to request
that it be reloaded, preserving (most of) the contents of main memory.
This is used by some versions of the OS to obtain crash dumps.

If a reload request fails (e.g. because the boot disk has been detached
in the interim, or because the original boot was from tape), the
processor halt with the stop code "Console FE halt".

The front end has the following registers:

name size comments

IBUF 8 input buffer

ICOUNT 32 count of input characters

ITIME 24 input polling interval (if 0, the keyboard

is polled synchronously with the clock)

OBUF 8 output buffer

OCOUNT 32 count of output characters

OTIME 24 console output response time

## Timer (TIM)

The timer (TIM) implements the system timer, the interval timer, and the
time of day clock used to get the date and time at system startup.
Because most PDP-10 software is not Y2K compliant, the timer implements
one option:

SET TIM NOY2K software not Y2K compliant, limit time

of day clock to 1999 (default)

SET TIM Y2K software is Y2K compliant

The timer has the following registers:

name size comments

TIMBASE 59 time base (double precision)

TTG 36 time to go (remaining time) for interval

PERIOD 36 reset value for interval

QUANT 36 quantum timer (ITS only)

TIME 24 tick delay

Unless the CPU is set to diagnostic mode, the timer autocalibrates; the
tick delay is adjusted up or down so that the time base tracks actual
elapsed time. This may cause time-dependent diagnostics to report
errors.

## PC11 Paper Tape Reader (PTR)

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader requires an unsupported driver under TOPS-10 and
is not supported under TOPS-20 or ITS.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

CSR 16 control/status register

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CSR\<15\>)

BUSY 1 busy flag (CSR\<11\>)

DONE 1 device done flag (CSR\<7\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR\<6\>)

POS 32 position in the input file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

end of file 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

## PC11 Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The paper tape punch requires an unsupported driver under TOPS-10 and is
not supported under TOPS-20 or ITS.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

CSR 16 control/status register

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CSR\<15\>)

DONE 1 device done flag (CSR\<7\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR\<6\>)

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

## DZ11 Terminal Multiplexer (DZ)

The DZ11 is an 8-line terminal multiplexer. Up to 4 DZ11's (32 lines)
are supported. The number of lines can be changed with the command

SET DZ LINES=n set line count to n

The line count must be a multiple of 8, with a maximum of 32.

The DZ11 supports three character processing modes, 7P, 7B, and 8B:

mode input characters output characters

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default is 7B, for compatibility with TOPS-20.

The DZ11 supports logging on a per-line basis. The command

SET DZ LOG=line=filename

enables logging for the specified line to the indicated file. The
command

SET DZ NOLOG=line

disables logging for the specified line and closes any open log file.
Finally, the command

SHOW DZ LOG

displays logging information for all DZ lines.

The terminal lines perform input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command specifies the
port to be used:

ATTACH {-am} DZ \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. The optional switch -m turns on the
DZ11's modem controls; the optional switch -a turns on active
disconnects (disconnect session if computer clears Data Terminal Ready).
Without modem control, the DZ behaves as though terminals were directly
connected; disconnecting the Telnet session does not cause any operating
system-visible change in line status.

Once the DZ is attached and the simulator is running, the DZ will listen
for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the incoming
connections are Telnet connections. The connection remains open until
disconnected by the simulated program, the Telnet client, a SET DZ
DISCONNECT command, or a DETACH DZ command.

Other special DZ commands:

> SHOW DZ CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW DZ STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET DZ DISCONNECT=linenumber disconnects the specified line.

The DZ11 implements these registers:

name size comments

CSR\[0:3\] 16 control/status register, boards 0 to 3

RBUF\[0:3\] 16 receive buffer, boards 0 to 3

LPR\[0:3\] 16 line parameter register, boards 0 to 3

TCR\[0:3\] 16 transmission control register, boards 0 to 3

MSR\[0:3\] 16 modem status register, boards 0 to 3

TDR\[0:3\] 16 transmit data register, boards 0 to 3

SAENB\[0:3\] 1 silo alarm enabled, boards 0 to 3

RXINT 4 receive interrupts, boards 3 to 0

TXINT 4 transmit interrupts, boards 3 to 0

MDMTCL 1 modem control enabled

AUTODS 1 autodisconnect enabled

The DZ11 does not support save and restore. All open connections are
lost when the simulator shuts down or the DZ is detached.

## Network controllers

### KDP-11 (KMC/DUP COMM IOP-DUP)

The primary, and officially supported networking device for the KS10 is
the KMC/DUP combination, running COMM IOP-DUP microcode. The combination
is called a KDP device. This combination presents a DMA device to the
operating system, with the KMC11-A handing DMA and DDCMP message
framing, and controlling one or more DUP11 synchronous communications
interfaces that transmit and receive the serial data on a synchronous
line. The protocol is DDCMP, and both DECnet and ANF-10 networking use
it to communicate among 36, 32, and 16-bit systems. The maximum line
speed of the real hardware is about 19,200 bps.

The KDP is emulated by SimH as two devices. Both must be enabled for
networking to function.

In standard configurations, the KMC requires no attention; the UNIBUS
address is fixed and only one KDP is supported by DEC software. The only
commands are:

> SET KDP ENABLE
> 
> SET KDP DISABLE
> 
> SHOW KDP STATUS

The OS determines which DUP11s are controlled by the KMC. Two lines is
the maximum supported by DEC software. The DUPs communicate over TCP/IP
with any SimH DDCMP networking device. The dup configuration commands
are:

> SET DUP ENABLE LINES={1 or 2}
> 
> SET DUP DISABLE
> 
> SET DUP SPEED={0 (unrestricted) | n (bits/sec)}
> 
> ATTACH DUPn remote
> 
> DETACH DUPn

The destination parameter determines how the virtual connection to
another system is established. There are two modes, which effect only
the establishment of the virtual connection; DDCMP itself is symmetric.

  - Passive: The DUP listens for a TCP connection from another system
    
      - Specify remote as ip\_address:port or port This is the
        interface/port on which the DUP will accept connections.
        ip\_address defaults to the ip wildcard address (any interface).

  - Active: The DUP actively establishes a connection with another
    system
    
      - Specify remote as connect=ip\_address:port or port. This is the
        address of the remote virtual host. ip\_address defaults to
        localhost.

The TCP connection will be established/dropped when the simulated OS
enables/disables the line. If the remote system is not up/establishing
connections, passive lines will accept connections at any time while the
simulation is running. Active lines will attempt to connect to their
designated remote periodically. No user action is required.

### DMR11 Unibus DDCMP Controller

The DMR11 is a synchronous serial point-to-point communications device.
It is supported by TOPS-10, but not by TOPS-20. The DMR11 offloads all
DDCMP processing from the OS, and is capable of megabit speeds.

The DMR11 can be used for point-to-point DDCMP connections carrying
DECnet and other types of networking, e.g. from ULTRIX or DSM. TOPS-10
supports the DMR11 (it does not support its cousin device, the DMC11).
TOPS-20 does not support either.

The DMR is configured similarly to the KDP; the two devices can
interoperate.

## RH11 Adapter, RP04/05/06/07, RM02/03/05/80 drives (RP)

The RP controller implements the Massbus 18b (RH11) direct interface for
large disk drives. RP options include the ability to set units write
enabled or write locked, to set the drive type to one of six disk types,
or autosize:

SET RPn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET RPn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

SET RPn RM03 set type to RM03 (same as RM02)

SET RPn RM05 set type to RM05

SET RPn RM80 set type to RM80

SET RPn RP04 set type to RP04 (same as RP05)

SET RPn RP06 set type to RP06

SET RPn RP07 set type to RP07

SET RPn AUTOSIZE set type based on file size at attach

SET RPn BADBLOCK write bad block table on last track

The type options can be used only when a unit is not attached to a file.
Note that TOPS-10 V7.03 supported only the RP06 and RM03; V7.04 added
support for the RP07 (patches are required for it to work.). TOPS-20
V4.1 also supported only the RP06 and RM03. Units can be set ENABLED or
DISABLED. The RP controller supports the BOOT command.

The RP controller implements these registers:

name size comments

RPCS1 16 control/status 1

RPWC 16 word count

RPBA 16 bus address

RPCS2 16 control/status 2

RPDB 16 data buffer

RPDA\[0:7\] 16 desired surface, sector

RPMR2\[0:7\] 16 maintenance register 2, drives 0 to 7

IFF 1 transfer complete interrupt request flop

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

SC 1 special condition (CSR1\<15\>)

DONE 1 device done flag (CSR1\<7\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR1\<6\>)

STIME 24 seek time, per cylinder

RTIME 24 rotational delay

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

end of file x assume rest of disk is zero

OS I/O error x report error and stop

## RH11 Adapter, TM02 Formatter, TU45 Magnetic Tape (TU)

The magnetic tape simulator simulates an RH11 Massbus adapter with one
TM02 formatter and up to eight TU45 drives. Magnetic tape options
include the ability to make units write enabled or locked.

SET TUn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET TUn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

SET TUn CAPAC=m set unit n capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)

SHOW TUn CAPAC show unit n capacity in MB

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The TU controller supports
the BOOT command.

The magnetic tape controller implements these registers:

name size comments

MTCS1 16 control/status 1

MTBA 16 memory address

MTWC 16 word count

MTFC 16 frame count

MTCS2 16 control/status 2

MTFS 16 formatter status

IE 1 interrupt enable flag

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

TIME 24 delay

UST\[0:7\] 16 unit status, units 0 to 7

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, units 0 to 7

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready; if STOP\_IOE, stop

end of file operation incomplete

OS I/O error parity error; if STOP\_IOE, stop

## LP20 DMA Line Printer (LP20)

The LP20 is a DMA-based line printer controller. There is one line
printer option to clear the vertical forms unit (VFU):

SET LP20 VFUCLEAR clear the vertical forms unit and  
translation table

Additionally:

> SET LP20 VFUTYPE=DAVFU (Default) Printer has an electronic VFU
> 
> SET LP20 VFUTYPE=OPTICAL Printer has an optically-read paper tape VFU
> 
> SET LP20 VFUTYPE=OPTICAL=file Specifies an ASCII VFU file that defines
> the paper tape.
> 
> SET LP20 LPI={6-LPI|8-LPI} Specifies the vertical pitch of the printer
> (6 is default)
> 
> SET LP20 TOPOFFORM Advances the VFU to the top-of-form channel,
> aligning it with the output.

SHOW VFU Displays the currently loaded VFU (electronic or optical)

The default optical VFU file is the DEC standard tape for a 66 line,
6LPI form with FORTRAN carriage control. There is no default DAVFU tape;
the host OS is responsible for loading one.

The VFU file for optical VFUs has the following format:

  - \# anything - a comment

  - ; anything - alternate comment

  - \! anything - also a comment

  - ll:  
    Defines the line number ll (decimal) to have no channels punched

  - ll: c1 c2...  
    Defines line ll to have channel(s) c1 c2 (decimal) punched. Channels
    are 1-12

A tape **must** have at least one punch in channel 1, the top-of-form
channel.

A tape **should** have at least one punch in channel 12, the
bottom-of-form channel.

A tape has a minimum form length of two inches and a maximum length of
143 lines.

Sample VFU file (partial):

> \# Sample Optical VFU tape for LP20
> 
> 0: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
>

Output goes to a file specified with

ATTACH LP20 file

The standard attach switches are supported. The default position after
ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A new file can be
created if you attach with the -N switch.

The file is flushed after 10 seconds of idle time; this allows
inspection/capture of the output when a job finishes without requiring
the simulator to halt.

The LP20 implements these registers:

name size comments

LPCSA 16 control/status register A

LPCSB 16 control/status register B

LPBA 16 bus address register

LPBC 12 byte count register

LPPAGC 12 page count register

LPRDAT 12 RAM data register

LPCBUF 8 character buffer register

LPCOLC 8 column counter register

LPPDAT 8 printer data register

LPCSUM 8 checksum register

DVPTR 7 vertical forms unit pointer

DVLNT 7 vertical forms unit length

INT 1 interrupt request

ERR 1 error flag

DONE 1 done flag

IE 1 interrupt enable flag

POS 32 position in output file

TIME 24 response time

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

TXRAM\[0:255\] 12 translation RAM

DAVFU\[0:142\] 12 vertical forms unit array

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

## RX211/RX02 Floppy Disk (RY)

RX211 options include the ability to set units write enabled or write
locked, single or double density, or autosized:

SET RYn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET RYn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

SET RYn SINGLE set unit n single density

SET RYn DOUBLE set unit n double density (default)

SET RYn AUTOSIZE set unit n autosized

The floppy disk requires an unsupported driver under TOPS-10 and is not
supported under TOPS-20 or ITS.

The RX211 implements these registers:

name size comments

RYCS 16 status

RYBA 16 buffer address

RYWC 8 word count

RYDB 16 data buffer

RYES 12 error status

RYERR 8 error code

RYTA 8 current track

RYSA 8 current sector

STAPTR 4 controller state

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CSR\<15\>)

TR 1 transfer ready flag (CSR\<7\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CSR\<6\>)

DONE 1 device done flag (CSR\<5\>)

CTIME 24 command completion time

STIME 24 seek time, per track

XTIME 24 transfer ready delay

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

SBUF\[0:255\] 8 sector buffer array

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

RX02 data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.

## CD20 Card Reader (CR)

The card reader (CR) implements a single controller (CD20) and card
reader (e.g., Documation M200, GDI Model 100) by reading a file and
presenting lines or cards to the simulator. Card decks may be
represented by plain text ASCII files, card image files, or column
binary files.

Card image files are a file format designed by Douglas W. Jones at the
University of Iowa to support the interchange of card deck data. These
files have a much richer information carrying capacity than plain ASCII
files. Card Image files can contain such interchange information as
card-stock color, corner cuts, special artwork, as well as the binary
punch data representing all 12 columns. Complete details on the format,
as well as sample code, are available at Prof. Jones's site:
http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/\~jones/cards/.

The card reader supports ASCII, card image, and column binary format
card “decks.” When reading plain ASCII files, lines longer than 80
characters are silently truncated. Card image support is included for 80
column Hollerith, 82 column Hollerith (silently ignoring columns 0 and
81), and 40 column Hollerith (mark-sense) cards. Column binary supports
80 column card images only. All files are attached read-only (as if the
-R switch were given).

ATTACH –A CR \<file\> file is ASCII text

ATTACH –B CR \<file\> file is column binary

ATTACH –I CR \<file\> file is card image format

If no flags are given, the file extension is evaluated. If the filename
ends in .TXT, the file is treated as ASCII text. If the filename ends in
.CBN, the file is treated as column binary. Otherwise, the CR driver
looks for a card image header. If a correct header is found the file is
treated as card image format, otherwise it is treated as ASCII text.

The correct character translation MUST be set if a plain text file is to
be used for card deck input. The correct translation SHOULD be set to
allow correct ASCII debugging of a card image or column binary input
deck. Depending upon the operating system in use, how it was generated,
and how the card data will be read and used, the translation must be set
correctly so that the proper character set is used by the driver. Use
the following command to explicitly set the correct translation:

SET TRANSLATION={DEFAULT|026|026FTN|029|EBCDIC|026DECASCII|029DECASCII}

This command should be given after a deck is attached to the simulator.
The mappings above are completely described at
http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/\~jones/cards/codes.html. Note that DEC
typically used 029 or 026FTN mappings. The 36-bit device drivers use
those tables, however most card I/O is though the GALAXY Batch
subsystem, which uses the DECASCII translations. (These include codes
for full 7-bit ASCII translation.)

DEC operating systems used a variety of methods to determine the end of
a deck (recognizing that 'hopper empty' does not necessarily mean the
end of a deck. Below is a summary of the various operating system
conventions for signaling end of deck:

RT-11: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

RSTS/E: 12-11-0-1 or 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

RSX: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch

VMS: 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in first 8 columns

TOPS: 12-11-0-1 or 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in column 1

Using the AUTOEOF setting, the card reader can be set to automatically
generate an EOF card consisting of the 12-11-0-1-6-7-8-9 punch in
columns 1-8. When set to CD11 mode, this switch also enables automatic
setting of the EOF bit in the controller after the EOF card has been
processed. \[The CR11 does not have a similar capability.\] By default
AUTOEOF is enabled.

SET CR AUTOEOF

SET CR NOAUTOEOF

The default card reader rate for the CD11 is 1000 cpm. The reader rate
can be set to its default value or to anywhere in the range 200..1200
cpm. This rate may be changed while the unit is attached.

SET CR RATE={DEFAULT|200..1200}

It is standard operating procedure for operators to load a card deck and
press the momentary action RESET button to clear any error conditions
and alert the processor that a deck is available to read. Use the
following command to simulate pressing the card reader RESET button,

SET CR RESET

Another common control of physical card readers is the STOP button. An
operator could use this button to finish the read operation for the
current card and terminate reading a deck early. Use the following
command to simulate pressing the card reader STOP button.

SET CR STOP

Some card readers have an EOF button, which signals EOF/End of Job via a
hardware register. This is the preferred mechanism for GALAXY Batch
spoolers. To signal EOF use

SET CR EOF

The command may be given at any time; the signal happens at the end of
(attached) input file.

The simulator will optionally report cards with punches in column 0 or
81as READER CHECKs, as did most card readers.

SET CR RDCHECK

The simulator does not support the BOOT command. The simulator does not
stop on file I/O errors. Instead the controller signals a reader check
to the CPU.

The CR controller implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 ASCII value of last column processed

CRS 16 CR11 status register

CRB1 16 CR11 12-bit Hollerith character

CRB2 16 CR11 8-bit compressed character

CRM 16 CR11 maintenance register

CDST 16 CD11 control/status register

CDCC 16 CD11 column count

CDBA 16 CD11 current bus address

CDDB 16 CD11 data buffer, 2nd status

BLOWER 2 blower state value

INT 1 interrupt pending flag

ERR 1 error flag (CRS\<15\>)

IE 1 interrupt enable flag (CRS\<6\>)

POS 32 file position - do not alter

TIME 24 delay time between columns

The CD11 simulation includes the Rev. J modification to make the CDDB
act as a second status register during non-data transfer periods.

# Symbolic Display and Input

The PDP-10 simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

\-a display as ASCII character

\-c display as six sixbit packed characters

\-p display as five packed ASCII (7b) characters

\-m display instruction mnemonics

\-v interpret address as virtual

\-e force executive mode

\-u force user mode

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

' or -a ASCII character

" or -c six sixbit packed characters

\# or -p five packed ASCII (7b) characters

alphabetic instruction mnemonic

numeric octal number

Instruction input uses standard PDP-10 assembler syntax. There are three
instruction classes: memory reference, memory reference with AC, and
I/O.

Memory reference instructions have the format

memref {@}address{(index)}

memory reference with AC instructions have the format

memac ac,{@}address{(index)}

and I/O instructions have the format

io device,{@}address{(index)}

where @ signifies indirect. The address is a signed octal number in the
range 0 - 0777777. The ac and index are unsigned octal numbers in the
range 0-17. The device is either a recognized device mnemonic (APR, PI,
TIM) or an octal number in the range 0 - 0177.

The simulator recognizes the standard MACRO alternate mnemonics (CLEAR
for SETZ, OR for IORI), the individual definitions for JRST and JFCL
variants, and the extended instruction mnemonics.
