# SSEM Features

The SSEM is configured as follows:

> device names simulates
> 
> CPU SSEM CPU with 32 words of memory

The LOAD and DUMP commands are implemented. They use a binary file with
the extension .st (“store”)

## CPU

The CPU implements Manchester SSEM (Small Scale Experimental Machine):

Memory size is fixed at 32 words. Memory is 32b wide.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor system.

name size comments

CI 5 current instruction

A 32 accumulator

# Symbolic Display and Input

The SSEM simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

\-h display as hexadecimal

\-d display as decimal

\-b display as backwards binary. Least Significant Bit

> first.

\-m display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

opcode instruction mnemonic

There is only one instruction format:

op address

Instructions follows the mnemonic style used in the 1998 competition
reference manual:

"The Manchester University Small Scale Experimental Machine Programmer's
Reference manual"

<http://www.computer50.org/mark1/prog98/ssemref.html>

'op' is one of the following ‘JMP’, ‘JRP’, ‘LDN’, ‘STO’, ‘SUB’, ‘CMP’ or
‘STOP’. A linear address is one decimal number between 0 and 31. For
example:

sim\> d -m 31 LDN 21

sim\> ex -m 31

31: LDN 21

sim\> ex -h 31

31: 00004015

sim\> ex -b 31

31: 10101000000000100000000000000000

sim\> ex -d 31

31: 16405
