Most devices can be disabled or enabled with the SET \<dev\> DISABLED
and SET \<dev\> ENABLED commands, respectively.

The LOAD command is used to load a line printer carriage-control tape.
The DUMP command is not implemented.

CPU
---

The CPU options set the size of main memory and the configuration of
peripherals.

SET CPU 16K set memory size = 16KW

SET CPU 32K set memory size = 32KW

SET CPU 48K set memory size = 48KW

SET CPU 64K set memory size = 64KW

SET CPU GENIE enable DRM, set terminal mux to GENIE mode

SET CPU SDS disable DRM, set terminal mux to SDS mode

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 64KW.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 65536 entries, the minimum length
is 64 entries. This history records the CPU mode when the instruction
was executed (normal, monitor or user). The SET CPU HISTORY command
accepts one switch value to optionally suppress recording of
instructions in a particular CPU mode:

SET --n CPU HISTORY=n don't record if in normal mode

SET --m CPU HISTORY=n don't record if in monitor mode

SET --u CPU HISTORY=n don't record if in user mode

The SDS 940 simulator implements four types of execution breakpoints,
controlled by command line switches:

-e break if P equals address, unqualified by machine mode

-m break if P equals address, machine in monitor mode

-n break if P equals address, machine in normal (SDS 930) mode

-u break if P equals address, machine in user mode

Breakpoint commands default to --e behavior if no switch is specified.

### Next Command

The Next command is supported to step over a BRM, POP, or SYSPOP
instruction by installing temporary breakpoints at P+1 and P+2 (and P+3
in the case of a BRM) and then executing the Go command. The temporary
breakpoints are removed should execution be interrupted for any other
reason. For other instructions, Next is converted to a Step command.

Like the Step command, the Next command accepts a repeat count as an
argument. Given this code sequence:

1532: BRM 1220 \<\-- P

1533: LDA 4663

1534: POP 3214

1535: BRU 4436 \<\-- non-skip return from POP

1536: BRM 3260 \<\-- skip return from POP

1537: ZRO 3455 \<\-- argument to subroutine

1540: BRU 1600 \<\-- error return

1541: STA 4652 \<\-- normal return

The following behavior would be observed for various Next commands
executed when P=1532:

Step advance to location 1220

Next advance to location 1533

Next 2 advance to location 1534

Next 3 advance to location 1535 or 1536 depending on whether POP skips
on return

With P=1536, the behavior is thus:

Step advance to location 3260

Next advance to location 1540 or 1541

Unlike the Step command, a side-effect of using temporary breakpoints is
that diversions into interrupt or trap code become invisible. With a
Step command, execution dutifully follows into the interrupt or trap
routine.

Next command accepts two mutually exclusive switches to modify its
behavior.

The --f switch ("forward") instructs the Next command to set temporary
breakpoint(s) following the current location regardless of instruction
type. This is useful at the bottom of loops or to avoid going off into
unrelated code should an interrupt or memory paging trap occur. In this
example:

1532: BRX 1220 \<\-- P

1533: LDA 4663

a normal Next would advance to either location 1220 or 1533 depending
upon the value in the X register (it is converted to a Step). However,
Next --f would only advance to location 1533, allowing the loop code at
1220 to be executed as many times as specified by X. Note that if the
loop code branches elsewhere, rather than make the BRX test, control
will be lost unless caught by another breakpoint.

The --a switch ("atomic") alters Next behavior to be more like a Step
command, but using temporary breakpoints. That is, it will plant a
breakpoint at the effective address of a BRM or BRX instruction to catch
any transfer there. Its primary use is to step through code ignoring
interrupts and traps.

The behavior of various alternative forms of Next are illustrated in
this table for different opcodes, showing where temporary breakpoints
are placed. "Step" means Next is converted to a Step command. "LDA,
etc." means all non-skipping, non-branching opcodes, including I/O
instructions. "SKx" means all Skip instructions. The behavior of Next
with an EXU (execute) instruction is dependent on the instruction that
is eventually executed.

  --------------- --------------- ---------------------- -----------------------

  **SYSPOP**      P+1, P+2        100+OP, P+1, P+2       P+1, P+2
  --------------- --------------- ---------------------- -----------------------

Note that these temporary breakpoints are CPU-mode insensitive, so there
is the potential for conflict if execution in a different CPU mode
should encounter an instruction address numerically equal to any of
these temporary breakpoints.

Channels (CHAN)
---------------

The SDS 940 has up to eight I/O channels, designated W, Y, C, D, E, F,
G, and H. W, Y, C, and D are time-multiplexed communications channels
(TMCC); E, F, G, and H are direct access communications channels (DACC).
Unlike real SDS 940 channels, the simulated channels handle 6b, 12b, and
24b transfers simultaneously. The association between a device and a
channel is displayed by the SHOW \<dev\> CHAN command:

SHOW LPT CHAN

channel=W

The user can change the association with the SET \<dev\> CHAN=\<chan\>
command, where \<chan\> is a channel letter:

SET LPT CHAN=E

SHOW LPT CHAN

channel=E

Each channel has nine registers. The registers are arrays, with entry
\[0\] for channel W, entry \[1\] for channel Y, etc.

name size comments

UAR\[0:7\] 6 unit address register

WCR\[0:7\] 15 word count register

The console input (TTI) polls the console keyboard for input. It
implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 6 data buffer

XFR 1 transfer ready flag

POS 32 number of characters input

TIME 24 polling interval

By default, the console input is assigned to channel W.

Console Output (TTO)
--------------------

The console output (TTO) writes to the simulator console window. It
implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 6 data buffer

XFR 1 transfer ready flag

POS 32 number of characters output

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

By default, the console output is assigned to channel W.

Paper Tape Reader (PTR)
-----------------------

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 6 data buffer

XFR 1 transfer ready flag

SOR 1 start of record flag

CHAN 4 active channel

POS 32 position in the input file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

The paper-tape reader supports the BOOT command. BOOT PTR simulates the
standard console fill sequence.

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

end of file 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

By default, the paper tape reader is assigned to channel W.

Paper Tape Punch (PTP)
----------------------

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 6 data buffer

XFR 1 transfer ready flag

LDR 1 punch leader flag

CHAN 4 active channel

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

By default, the paper tape punch is assigned to channel W.

Line Printer (LPT)
------------------

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer.

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

By default, the line printer is assigned to channel W.

Real-Time Clock (RTC)
---------------------

The real-time clock (RTC) frequency can be adjusted as follows:

SET RTC 60HZ set frequency to 60Hz

SET RTC 50HZ set frequency to 50Hz

The default is 60Hz.

The clock implements these registers:

name size comments

PIE 1 interrupt enable

TIME 24 tick interval

The real-time clock autocalibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

Terminal Multiplexer (MUX)
--------------------------

The terminal multiplexer provides 32 asynchronous interfaces. In Genie
mode, the interfaces are hard-wired; in SDS mode, they implement modem
control. The multiplexer has two controllers: MUX for the scanner, and
MUXL for the individual lines. The terminal multiplexer performs input
and output through Telnet sessions connected to a user-specified port.
The ATTACH command specifies the port to be used:

ATTACH MUX \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Each line (each unit of MUXL) supports one option: UC, when set, causes
lower case input characters to be automatically converted to upper case.
In addition, each line supports output logging. The SET MUXLn LOG
command enables logging on a line:

SET MUXLn filename log output of line n to filename

The SET MUXLn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once MUX is attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexor
listens for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the
incoming connections are Telnet connections. The connections remain open
until

disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET MUX DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH MUX command.

Other special multiplexer commands:

> SHOW MUX CONNECTIONS show current connections
>
> SHOW MUX STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
>
> SET MUXLn DISCONNECT disconnects the specified line.

The controller (MUX) implements these registers:

name size comments

STA\[0:31\] 6 status, lines 0 to 31

RBUF\[0:31\] 8 receive buffer, lines 0 to 31

XBUF\[0:31\] 8 transmit buffer, lines 0 to 31

FLAGS\[0:127\] 1 line flags, 0 to 3 for line 0,

4 to 7 for line 1, etc

SCAN 7 scanner current flag number

SLCK 1 scanner locked flag

TPS 8 character polls per second

The lines (MUXL) implements these registers:

name size comments

TIME\[0:31\] 24 transmit time, lines 0 to 31

The terminal multiplexor does not support save and restore. All open
connections are lost when the simulator shuts down or MUX is detached.

Project Genie Drum (DRM)
------------------------

The Project Genie drum (DRM) implements these registers:

name size comments

DA 19 drum address

CA 16 core address

WC 14 word count

PAR 12 cumulative sector parity

RW 1 read/write flag

ERR 1 error flag

STA 2 drum state

FTIME 24 channel program fetch time

XTIME 24 interword transfer time

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 drum not ready

Drum data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur. Unlike conventional SDS 940 devices, the
Project Genie drum does not use a channel.

Rapid Access (Fixed Head) Disk (RAD)
------------------------------------

The rapid access disk (RAD) implements these registers:

name size comments

DA 15 disk address

SA 6 sector word address

BP 1 sector byte pointer

XFR 1 data transfer flag

NOBD 1 inhibit increment across track

ERR 1 error flag

CHAN 4 active channel

PROT 8 write protect switches

TIME 24 interval between halfword transfers

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

The rapid access disk is buffered in memory; end of file and OS I/O
errors cannot occur. If it is assigned to channel W, bootstrap fill from
the device is permitted. By default, the rapid access disk is assigned
to channel E and bootstrapping is not permitted.

Moving Head Disk (DSK)
----------------------

DSK options include the ability to make the drive write enabled or write
locked:

SET RAD LOCKED set write locked

SET RAD WRITEENABLED set write enabled

The moving head disk implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF\[0:63\] 8 transfer buffer

BPTR 9 buffer pointer

BLNT 9 buffer length

DA 21 disk address

INST 24 disk instruction

XFR 1 data transfer flag

ERR 1 error flag

CHAN 4 active channel

WTIME 24 interval between character transfers

STIME 24 seek interval

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 disk not ready

end of file x assume rest of disk is zero

OS I/O error x report error and stop

By default, the moving head disk is assigned to channel F.

Magnetic Tape (MT)
------------------

MT options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked.

SET MTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

SET MTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

SET MTn CAPAC=m set unit n capacity to m MB (0 = unlimited)

SHOW MTn CAPAC show unit n capacity in MB

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The magnetic tape controller
supports the BOOT command. BOOT MTn simulates the standard console fill
sequence for unit n.

The magnetic tape implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF\[0:131071\] 8 transfer buffer

BPTR 18 buffer pointer

BLNT 18 buffer length

XFR 1 data transfer flag

CHAN 4 active channel

INST 24 magtape instruction

EOF 1 end-of-file flag

GAP 1 inter-record gap flag

SKIP 1 skip data flag

CTIME 24 interval between character transfers

GTIME 24 gap interval

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, drives 0 to 7

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached tape not ready; if STOP\_IOE, stop

end of file end of tape

OS I/O error end of tape; if STOP\_IOE, stop

By default, the magnetic tape is assigned to channel W.

Symbolic Display and Input
==========================

The SDS 940 simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

-a display as three SDS internal ASCII characters

-c display as four packed SDS 6b characters

-m display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

\' or -a three packed SDS internal ASCII characters

\" or -c four packed SDS 6b characters

alphabetic instruction mnemonic

numeric octal number

Instruction input uses (more or less) standard SDS 940 assembler syntax.
There are ten instruction classes:

> class operands examples comments
>
> no operand none EIR
>
> POP (prog op) op,addr{,tag} POP 66,100
>
> I/O addr{,tag} EOM 1266
>
> mem reference addr{,tag} LDA 400,2
>
> STA\* 300 indirect addr
>
> reg change op op op\... CLA CLB opcodes OR
>
> shift cnt{,tag} LSH 10
>
> operand ignored any NOP
>
> chan command chan ALC W
>
> chan test chan CAT Y
>
> SYSPOP (prog op) op,addr{,tag} BRS 42
>
> SBRM 500
>
> CIN\* 400,2

All numbers are octal. Channel designators can be alphabetic (W, Y, C,
D, E, F, G, H) or numeric (0-7). Tags must be 0-7, with 2 indicating
indexing.

In addition, all display and input commands may specify how the address
is mapped to main memory via a command line switch:

-n normal, address is an absolute physical address

-x monitor, map address through the monitor memory map

-u user, map address through the user memory map

-v current, map address through the monitor or user map

depending upon current machine mode

Memory mapping defaults to --n behavior if no switch is specified.
