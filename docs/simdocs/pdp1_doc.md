The PDP-1 simulator implements the following unique stop conditions:

  - An unimplemented instruction is decoded, and register STOP\_INST is
    set

  - More than IND\_MAX indirect addresses are detected during memory
    reference address decoding

  - More than XCT\_MAX nested executes are detected during instruction
    execution

  - I/O wait, and no I/O operations outstanding (i.e, no I/O completion
    will ever occur)

  - A simulated DECtape runs off the end of its reel

The LOAD command supports RIM format tapes and BLK format tapes. If the
file to be loaded has an extension of .BIN, or switch -B is specified,
the file is assumed to be BLK format; otherwise, it defaults to RIM
format. LOAD takes an optional argument that specifies the starting
address of the field to be loaded:

LOAD lisp.rim load RIM format file lisp.rim

LOAD ddt.rim 70000 load RIM format file ddt.rim into

the field starting at 70000

LOAD -B macro.blk load BLK format file macro.blk

The DUMP command is not implemented.

## CPU

The only CPU options are the presence of hardware multiply/divide and
the size of main memory.

SET CPU MDV enable multiply/divide

SET CPU NOMDV disable multiply/divide

SET CPU SBS16 enable 16-channel sequence break system

SET CPU NOSBS16 disable 16-channel sequence break system

SET CPU PDP1C set CPU to standard PDP-1C

SET CPU PDP1DS45 set CPU to PDP-1D, serial\# 45 (BBN)

SET CPU PDP1DS48 set CPU to PDP-1D, serial\# 48 (Stanford)

SET CPU 4K set memory size = 4K

SET CPU 8K set memory size = 8K

SET CPU 12K set memory size = 12K

SET CPU 16K set memory size = 16K

SET CPU 20K set memory size = 20K

SET CPU 24K set memory size = 24K

SET CPU 28K set memory size = 28K

SET CPU 32K set memory size = 32K

SET CPU 48K set memory size = 48K

SET CPU 64K set memory size = 64K

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 64K. Setting
the CPU to PDP-1D also enables multiply/divide and the 16-channel
sequence break system.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

EXTM\_INIT 1 initial state of extend mode

XCT\_MAX 8 maximum XCT chain

IND\_MAX 8 maximum nested indirect addresses

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

SET CPU HISTORY clear history buffer

SET CPU HISTORY=0 disable history

SET CPU HISTORY=n enable history, length = n

SHOW CPU HISTORY print CPU history

SHOW CPU HISTORY=n print first n entries of CPU history

The maximum length for the history is 65536 entries.

If the 16-channel sequence break system is enabled, devices can be
assigned to any break level between 0 (the default) and 15, with the
following command:

SET \<dev\> SBSLVL=n assign device to sequence break level n

Because each PDP-1 configuration was unique, there are no default
assignments for the 16-channel sequence break system.

## Programmed I/O Devices

### Paper Tape Reader (PTR)

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from or a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader supports the BOOT command. BOOT PTR copies the RIM
loader into memory and starts it running. BOOT PTR loads into the field
selected by TA\<0:3\> (the high order four bits of the address

switches).

The paper tape reader recognizes one switch at ATTACH time:

ATT –A PTR \<file\> convert input characters from ASCII

By default, the paper tape reader does no conversions on input
characters.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

DONE 1 device done flag

RPLS 1 return restart pulse flag

POS 32 position in the input file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

end of file 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file.

The paper tape punch recognizes two switches at ATTACH time:

ATT –A PTP \<file\> output characters as ASCII text

ATT –N PTP \<file\> create a new (empty) output file

By default, the paper tape punch punches files with no conversions.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

DONE 1 device done flag

RPLS 1 return restart pulse flag

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Console Typewriter Input (TTI), Output (TTO)

The Typewriter is a half-duplex electric typewriter (originally a Friden
Flexowriter, later a Sorobon-modified IBM B). It has only a single
buffer and a single carriage state but distinct input and output done
and interrupt flags. The typewriter input (TTI) polls the console
keyboard for input. The typewriter output (TTO) writes to the simulator
console window.

The Typewriter recognizes one option:

SET TTO ET Expensive Typewriter mode

SET TTO NOET normal mode

In Expensive Typewriter mode, ribbon changes are output as strings
(\[red\], \[black\]) to indicate which mode the program is in (red for
command, black for text). In normal mode, ribbon changes are ignored.

The typewriter input implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 6 typewriter buffer (shared)

UC 1 upper case/lower case state (shared)

DONE 1 input ready flag

POS 32 number of characters input

TIME 24 keyboard polling interval

The typewriter output implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 6 typewriter buffer (shared)

UC 1 upper case/lower case state (shared)

RPLS 1 return restart pulse flag

DONE 1 output done flag

POS 32 number of characters output

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

### Type 62 Line Printer (LPT)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The line printer can be disabled and enabled with the SET LPT DISABLED
and SET LPT ENABLED commands, respectively.

The line printer implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

PNT 1 printing done flag

SPC 1 spacing done flag

RPLS 1 return restart pulse flag

BPTR 6 print buffer pointer

POS 32 position in the output file

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

LBUF\[0:119\] 8 line buffer

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 out of tape or paper

OS I/O error x report error and stop

### Type 550/555 Microtape (DECtape) (DT)

The PDP-1 uses the Type 550 Microtape (later renamed DECtape), a
programmed I/O controller. PDP-1 DECtape format has 4 18b words in its
block headers and trailers.

DECtapes drives are numbered 1-8; in the simulator, drive 8 is unit 0.
DECtape options include the ability to make units write enabled or write
locked.

SET DTn WRITEENABLED set unit n write enabled

SET DTn LOCKED set unit n write locked

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The DECtape controller can be disabled and enabled with the SET DT
DISABLED and SET DT ENABLED commands, respectively.

The Type 550 supports PDP-8 format, PDP-11 format, and 18b format
DECtape images. ATTACH assumes the image is in 18b format; the user can
other choices with switches:

\-t PDP-8 format

\-s PDP-11 format

\-a autoselect based on file size

The DECtape controller is a data-only simulator; the timing and mark
track, and block header and trailer, are not stored. Thus, the WRITE
TIMING AND MARK TRACK function is not supported; the READ ALL function
always returns the hardware standard block header and trailer; and the
WRITE ALL function dumps non-data words into the bit bucket.

The DECtape controller implements these registers:

name size comments

DTSA 12 status register A

DTSB 12 status register B

DTDB 18 data buffer

DTF 1 DECtape flag

BEF 1 block end flag

ERF 1 error flag

LTIME 31 time between lines

DCTIME 31 time to decelerate to a full stop

SUBSTATE 2 read/write command substate

POS\[0:7\] 32 position, in lines, units 0-7

STATT\[0:7\] 18 unit state, units 0-7

STOP\_OFFR 1 stop on off-reel error

It is critically important to maintain certain timing relationships
among the DECtape parameters, or the DECtape simulator will fail to
operate correctly.

  - LTIME must be at least 6

  - DCTIME needs to be at least 100 times LTIME

Acceleration time is set to 75% of deceleration time.

### PDP-1D Timesharing Clock (CLK)

The PDP-1D implements a timesharing clock, which operates at 1Khz. The
clock has a readable counter and generates interrupts at 32 ms and 1
minute intervals. There is no other visible state. The clock is disabled
by default.

The clock implements these registers:

name size comments

CNTR 16 clock counter, range 0-59999<sub>10</sub>

The clock requires the 16-channel sequence break system and is assigned
to two different SBS levels:

SET CLK SBS32MS=n assign 32 msec interrupt to SBS level n

SET CLK SBS1MIN=n assign 1 minute interrupt to SBS level n

### Type 630 Data Communications Subsystem (DCS, DCSL)

The Type 630 Data Communications Subsystem provides up to 32
asynchronous interfaces. The Type 630 consists of two independent
devices: DCS for the scanner, and DCSL for the individual lines. The
terminal multiplexer performs input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The ATTACH command specifies the
port to be used:

ATTACH DCS \<port\> set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. The number of lines can be changed
with SET DCL LINES command:

SET DCS LINES=n set number of lines to n, where n is 1-32

Each line (each of unit of DCSL) can be set to one of four modes: UC,
7P, 7B, or 8B.

mode input characters output characters

UC lower case converted lower case converted to upper case,

to upper case, high-order bit cleared,

high-order bit cleared non-printing characters suppressed

7P high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared,

non-printing characters suppressed

7B high-order bit cleared high-order bit cleared

8B no changes no changes

The default mode is UC. Finally, each line supports output logging. The
SET DCSLn LOG command enables logging on a line:

SET DCSLn LOG=filename log output of line n to filename

The SET DCSLn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once DCS is attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer
listens for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the
incoming connections are Telnet connections. The connections remain open
until disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET DCS DISCONNECT
command, or a DETACH DCS command.

Other special commands:

> SHOW DCS CONNECTIONS show current connections
> 
> SHOW DCS STATISTICS show statistics for active connections
> 
> SET DCSLn DISCONNECT disconnects the specified line.

The multiplexer scanner (DCS) implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF\[0:31\] 8 input buffer, lines 0 to 31

FLG\[0:31\] 1 line ready flag, lines 0 to 31

SCNF 1 scanner ready flag

SCAN 5 scanner line number

SEND 5 output line number

The individual lines (DCSL) implement these registers:

name size comments

TIME\[0:31\] 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt,

lines 0 to 31

The multiplexer does not support save and restore. All open connections
are lost when the simulator shuts down or DSC is detached.

## Drums

The PDP-1 supports two drums: the Type 23 parallel drum (DRP) and the
Type 24 serial drum (DRM). Both use device addresses 061-064;
accordingly, only one can be enabled at a time. By default, the

Type 24 serial drum is enabled, and the Type 23 parallel drum is
disabled. The PDP-1D requires the Type 23 parallel drum.

### Type 24 Serial Drum (DRM)

The serial drum (DRM) implements these registers:

name size comments

DA 9 drum address (sector number)

MA 16 current memory address

DONE 1 device done flag

ERR 1 error flag

WLK 32 write lock switches

TIME 24 rotational latency, per word

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 drum not ready

Drum data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.

### Type 23 Parallel Drum (DRP)

The parallel drum (DRP) implements these registers:

name size comments

TA 12 track address

RDF 5 read field

RDE 1 read enable flag

WRF 5 write field

WRF 1 write enable flag

MA 16 current memory address

WC 12 word count

BUSY 1 device busy flag

ERR 1 error flag

TIME 24 rotational latency, per word

STOP\_IOE 1 stop on I/O error

Error handling is as follows:

error STOP\_IOE processed as

not attached 1 report error and stop

0 drum not ready

Drum data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.

# Symbolic Display and Input

The PDP-1 simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

\-a display as ASCII character

\-c display as three packed FIODEC characters

\-m display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

' or -a ASCII character

" or -c three packed FIODEC characters

alphabetic instruction mnemonic

numeric octal number

Instruction input uses modified PDP-1 assembler syntax. There are six
instruction classes: memory reference, shift, skip, operate, IOT, and
LAW.

Memory reference instructions have the format

memref {I} address

where I signifies indirect reference. The address is an octal number in
the range 0 - 0177777.

Shift instructions have the format

shift shift\_count

The shift count is an octal number in the range 0-9.

Skip instructions consist of single mnemonics, eg, SZA, SZS4. Skip
instructions may be or'd together

skip skip skip...

The sense of a skip can be inverted by including the mnemonic I.

Operate instructions consist of single mnemonics, eg, CLA, CLI. Operate
instructions may be or'd together

opr opr opr...

IOT instructions consist of single mnemonics, eg, TYI, TYO. IOT
instructions may include an octal numeric modifier or the modifier I:

iot modifier

The simulator does not check the legality of skip, operate, or IOT
combinations.

Finally, the LAW instruction has the format

LAW {I} immediate

where immediate is in the range 0 to 07777.

# Character Sets

The PDP-1's first console was a Frieden Flexowriter; its character
encoding was known as FIODEC. The PDP-1's line printer used a modified
Hollerith character set. The following table provides equivalences
between ASCII characters and the PDP-1's I/O devices. In the console
table, UC stands for upper case. The console table also applies to ASCII
mode for the paper tape reader and punch.
