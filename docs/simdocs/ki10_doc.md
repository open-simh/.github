 Introduction
============

Originally the DEC PDP10 computer started as the PDP6. This was a 36 bit
computer that was designed for timesharing, which was introduced in
1964. The original goal of the machine was to allow for processing of
many 6 bit characters at a time. 36 bits were also common in machines
like the IBM 7090, GE 645, and Univac 11xx lines. Several systems
influenced the design of the PDP6, like CTSS, Lisp, support for larger
memory. The PDP6 was canceled by DEC due to production problems. The
engineers designed a smaller replacement, which happened to be a 36 bit
computer that looked very much like the PDP6. This was called the PDP10.
Later renamed to \"DECSystem-10\". The system supported up to 256K words
of memory.

The first PDP10 was labeled KA10, and added a few instructions to the
PDP6. Both the PDP6 and PDP10 used a base and limit relocation scheme.
The KA10 generally offered two registers, one of user data and the
second for user shared code. These were referred to the Low-Segment and
High-Segment, the High-Segment could be shared with several jobs. The
next version was called KI10 for Integrated. This added support for
paging and double precision floating point instructions. It also added 4
sets of registers to improve context switching time. It could also
support up to 4Mega words of memory. Following the KI10 was the KL10
(for Low-Cost). The KL10 added double precision integer instructions and
instructions to improve COBOL performance. This was the first version
which was microcoded. The KL10 was extended to support user programs
larger then 256k. The final version to make it to market was the KS10
(for Small), this was a bit-slice version of the PDP10 which used UNIBUS
devices which were cheaper then the KL10 devices.

The original operating system for the PDP6/PDP10 was just called
\"Monitor\". It was designed to fit into 6K words. Around the 3rd
release Swapping was added. The 6\'th release saw the addition of
virtual memory. Around the 4\'th release it was given the name
\"TOPS-10\". Around this time BBN was working on a paging system and
implemented it on the PDP10. This was called \"Tenex\". This was later
adopted by DEC and became \"Tops-20\".

During the mid 60\'s a group at MIT, who where not happy with how
Multics was being developed decided to create their own operating system
which they called Incompatible Timesharing System \"ITS\", was a play on
the original project called Compatible Timesharing System \"CTSS\". CTSS
was implemented by MIT on their IBM 7090 as an experimental system that
allowed multiple time sharing users to co-exist on the same machine
running batch processing. Hence the term Compatable.

Also during the mid 60\'s a group at Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (SAIL), started with a version of TOPS-10 and heavily
modified it to become WAITS.

During the 70\'s Tymshare starting with DEC TOPS-10 system modified it
to support random access files, paging with working sets and spawn-able
processes. This ran on the KI10, KL10 and KS10.

The PDP10 was ultimately replaced by the VAX.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions.

This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU HISTORY commands:

###  DDC10 Drum controller for Tenex

DEC RES-10 drum controller, is used by Tenex for swapping. This device
is disabled by default.

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------
  SET CPU HISTORY        clear history buffer
  SET CPU HISTORY=0      disable history
  SET CPU HISTORY=*n*    enable history, length = n
  SHOW CPU HISTORY       print CPU history
  SHOW CPU HISTORY=*n*   print first n entries of CPU history
  ---------------------- --------------------------------------

Instruction tracing shows the Program counter, the contents of AC
selected, the computed effective address. AR is generally the contents
the memory location referenced by EA. RES is the result of the
instruction. FLAGS shows the flags after the instruction is executed. IR
shows the instruction being executed.

###  Card Reader (CR) (Device 150)

The card reader (CR) reads data from a disk file. Card reader files can
either be text (one character per column) or column binary (two
characters per column). The file type can be specified with a set
command:

  ------------------------- -------------------------------------
  SET CR*n* FORMAT=TEXT     Sets ASCII text mode
  SET CR*n* FORMAT=BINARY   Sets for binary card images.
  SET CR*n* FORMAT=BCD      Sets for BCD records.
  SET CR*n* FORMAT=CBN      Sets for column binary BCD records.
  SET CR*n* FORMAT=AUTO     Automatically determines format.
  ------------------------- -------------------------------------

or in the ATTACH command:

  --------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ATTACH CR*n* *\<file\>*                 Attaches a file
  ATTACH CR*n* -f *\<format\> \<file\>*   Attaches a file with the given format.
  ATTACH CR*n* -s \<*file*\>              Added file onto current cards to read.
  ATTACH CR*n* -e \<*file\>*              After file is read in, the reader will receive and end of file flag.
  --------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

###  Card Punch (CP) (Device 110)

The card reader (CP) writes data to a disk file. Cards are simulated as
ASCII lines with terminating newlines. Card punch files can either be
text (one character per column) or column binary (two characters per
column). The file type can be specified with a set command:

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------
  SET CP FORMAT=TEXT     Sets ASCII text mode
  SET CP FORMAT=BINARY   Sets for binary card images.
  SET CP FORMAT=BCD      Sets for BCD records.
  SET CP FORMAT=CBN      Sets for column binary BCD records.
  SET CP FORMAT=AUTO     Automatically determines format.
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------

or in the ATTACH command:

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
  ATTACH CP \<file\>                 Attaches a file
  ATTACH CP -f \<format\> \<file\>   Attaches a file with the given format.
  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------

###  Line Printer (LPT) (Device 124)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file as ASCII text with
terminating newlines. Currently set to handle standard signals to
control paper advance.

  ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SET LPT*n* LC                 Allow printer to print lower case
  SET LPT*n* UC                 Print only upper case
  SET LPT*n* UTF8               Print control characters as UTF8 characters.
  SET LPT*n* LINESPERPAGE=*n*   Sets the number of lines before an auto form feed is generated. There is an automatic margin of 6 lines. There is a maximum of 100 lines per page.
  SET LPT*n* DEV=*n*            Sets device number to *n*(octal).
  ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These characters control the skipping of various number of lines.

  ----------- --------------------------------------------
  Character   Effect
  014         Skip to top of form.
  013         Skip mod 20 lines.
  020         Skip mod 30 lines.
  021         Skip to even line.
  022         Skip to every 3 line
  023         Same as line feed (12), but ignore margin.
  ----------- --------------------------------------------

###  Type 340 Graphics display(DPY) (Device 130)

Primarily useful under ITS, TOPS10 does have some limited support for
this device. By default this device is not enabled. When enabled and

 Disk I/O Devices
----------------

The PDP10 supported many disk controllers.

###  FHA Disk Controller (Device 170)

The RC10 disk controller used a DF10 to transfer data to memory. There
were two types of disks that could be connected to the RC10 the RD10 and
RM10. The RD10 could hold up to 512K words of data. The RM10 could hold
up to 345K words of data.

Each individual disk drive support several options: FHA used as an
example.

###  DDC10 Drum controller for Tenex

DEC RES-10 drum controller, is used by Tenex for swapping. This device
is disabled by default.

 Massbus Devices
---------------

Massbus devices are attached via RH10's. Devices start a device 270 and
go up (274,360,364,370,374). For Tops10 devices need to be in a the
order RS, RP, TU. By default RS disks are disabled. The first unit which
is not enabled will get device 270, units will be assigned the next
available address automatically. The device configuration must match
that which is defined in the OS.

###  RP Disk drives 

Up to 4 strings of up to 8 RP drives can be configured. By default the
3^rd^ and 4^th^ controllers are disabled. These are addresses as RPA,
RPB, RPC, RPD. Disks can be stored in one of several file formats, SIMH,
DBD9 and DLD9. The later two are for compatibility with other
simulators.

###  DC10E Terminal Controller (Device 240)

The DC device was the standard terminal multiplexer for the KA10 and
KI10's. Lines came in groups of 8. For modem control there was a second
port for each line. These could be offset by any number of groups.

  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------
  SET DC LINES=*n*   Set the number of lines on the DC10, multiple of 8.
  SET DC MODEM=*n*   Set the start of where the modem control DEC10E lines begins.
  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------

All terminal multiplexers must be attached in order to work. The ATTACH
command specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

  ------------------------------ -----------------------
  ATTACH \<device\> *\<port\>*   Set up listening port
  ------------------------------ -----------------------

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used other TCP/IP activities.

Once attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens for
connections on the specified port. It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connections. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET \<device\> DISCONNECT
command,or a DETACH \<device\> command.

  ------------------------------- ---------------------
  SET \<device\> DISCONNECT=*n*   Disconnect line *n*
  ------------------------------- ---------------------

The \<device\> implements the following special SHOW commands

  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  SHOW \<device\> CONNECTIONS   Displays current connections to the \<device\>
  SHOW \<device\> STATISTICS    Displays statistics for active connections
  SHOW \<device\> LOG           Display logging for all lines.
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

Logging can be controlled as follows:

  ----------------------------------- --------------------------------------
  SET \<device\> LOG=*n*=*filename*   Log output of line *n* to *filename*
  SET \<device\> NOLOG                Disable logging and close log file
  ----------------------------------- --------------------------------------

 Network Devices.
----------------

###  IMP Interface Message Processor (Device 460)

This allows the KA/KI to connect to the Internet. Currently only
supported under ITS. ITS and other OS that used the IMP did not support
modern protocols and typically required a complete rebuild to change the
IP address. Because of this the IMP processor includes built in NAT and
DHCP support. For ITS the system generated IP packets which are
translated to the local network. If the HOST is set to 0.0.0.0 there
will be no translation. If HOST is set to an IP address then it will be
mapped into the address set in IP. If DHCP is enabled the IMP will issue
a DHCP request at startup and set IP to the address that is given. By
default this device is not enabled.

  ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SET IMP MAC=*xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx*     Set the MAC address of the IMP to the value given.
  SET IMP IP=*ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd*/*dd*   Set the external IP address of the IMP along with the net mask in bits.
  SET IMP GW=*ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd*        Set the Gateway address for the IMP.
  SET IMP HOST=*ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd*      Sets the IP address of the PDP10 system.
  SET IMP DHCP                        Allows the IMP to acquire an IP address from the local network via DHCP. Only HOST must be set if this feature is used.
  SET IMP NODHCP                      Disables the IMP from making DHCP queries
  SET IMP DHCPIP=*ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd*    The address of the DHCP server, generally this is for display only.
  SET IMP MIT                         Sets the IMP to look like the IMP used by MIT for ITS.
  SET IMP BBN                         Sets the IMP to behave like generic BBN IMP. (Not implemented yet).
  SET IMP WAITS                       Sets the IMP for Stanford style IMP for WAITS.
  ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IMP device must be attached to a TAP or NAT interface. To determine
which devices are available use the "SHOW ETHERNET" to list the
potential interfaces. Check out the "Readme\_ethernet.txt" from the doc
directory.

The IMP device can be configured in several ways. Ether it can connect
directly to an ethernet port (via TAP) or it can be connected via a TUN
interface. If configured via TAP interface the IMP will behave like any
other ethernet interface and if asked grab it's own address. In
environments where this is not desired the TUN interface can be used.
When configured under a TUN interface the simulated network is a
collection of ports on the local host. These can be mapped based on
configuration options, see the 0readme\_ethernet.txt file as to options.

With the IMP interface, the IP address of the simulated system is
static, and under ITS is configured into the system at compile time.
This address should be given to the IMP with the "set imp host=\<ip\>",
the IMP will direct all traffic it sees to this address. If this address
is not the same as the address of the system as seen by the network,
then this address can be set with "set imp ip=\<ip\>", and "set imp
gw=\<ip\>", or "set imp dhcp" which will allow the IMP to request an
address from a local DHCP server. The IMP will translate the packets it
receives/sends to look like the appeared from the desired address. The
IMP will also correctly translate FTP requests in this configuration.

When running under a TUN interface, IMP is on a virtual 10.0.2.0"
network. The default gateway is "10.0.2.1", with the default IMP at
"10.0.2.15". For this mode DHCP can be used.

 Symbolic Display and Input
==========================

The KI10 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are
controlled by the following switches to the EXAMINE and DEPOSIT
commands:

  ---- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -v   Looks up the address via translation, will return nothing if address is not valid.
  -u   With the -v option, used user space instead of executive space.
  -a   Display/Enter ASCII data.
  -p   Display/Enter packed ASCII data.
  -c   Display/Enter Sixbit Character data.
  -m   Display/Enter Symbolic instructions
       Display/Enter Octal data.
  ---- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symbolic instructions can be of the formats:

-   Opcode ac,operand

-   Opcode operands

-   I/O Opcode device,address

Operands can be one or more of the following in order:

-   Optional @ for indirection.

-   \+ or -- to set sign.

-   Octal number

-   Optional (ac) for indexing.

Breakpoints can be set at real memory address. The PDP10 supports 3
types of breakpoints. Execution, Memory Access and Memory Modify. The
default is execution. Adding -R to the breakpoint command will stop the
simulator on access to that memory location, either via fetch,
indirection or operand access. Adding -w will stop the simulator when
the location is modified.

The simulator can load RIM files, SAV files, EXE files, Waits Octal DMP
files, MIT SBLK files.

When instruction history is enabled, the history trace shows internal
status of various registers at the start of the instruction execution.

  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  PC      Shows the PC of the instruction executed.
  AC      The contents of the referenced AC.
  EA      The final computed Effective address.
  AR      Generally the operand that was computed.
  RES     The AR register after the instruction was complete.
  FLAGS   The values of the FLAGS register before execution of the instruction.
  IR      The fetched instruction followed by the disassembled instruction.
  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The PDP10 simulator allows for Memory reference and memory modify
breakpoints with the -r and -w options given to the break command.
