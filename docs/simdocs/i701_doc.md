1. Introduction
===============

The IBM 701 also know as \"Defense Calculator\" was introduced by IBM on
April 7, 1953. This computer was start of IBM 700 and 7000 line. Memory
was 2048 36 bit words. Each instruction could be signed plus or minus,
plus would access memory as 18 bit words, minus as 36 bit words. There
was a expansion option to add another 2048 words of memory, but I can\'t
find documentation on how it worked. Memory cycle time was 12
microseconds. The 701 was withdrawn from the market October 1, 1954
replaced by 704 and 702. A total of 19 machines were installed.

2. Simulator Files
==================

To compile the IBM 701, you must define USE\_INT64 and I701 as part of
the compilation command line.

3. IBM 701 Features
===================

The IBM 701 simulator is configured as follows:

  -------------------- ------------------------------
  **Device Name(s)**   **Simulates**
  **CPU**              701 CPU with 2KW of memory
  **CH**               701 Channel Device
  **MT**               729 Magnetic Tape Controller

  **LP**               716 Line Printer
  **DR0**              733 Drum
  -------------------- ------------------------------

The 701 simulator implements several unique stop condition:

-   undefined CPU instruction

-   divide check on a divide and halt instruction

-   write select of a write protected device

The LOAD command will load a card binary image file into memory. An
octal dump file, or a pseudo assembly code.

3.1 CPU
-------

Memory size is 2KW on a standard CPU.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

  ------------ ------------ ------------------------
  ***Name***   ***Size***   ***Comments***
  IC           15           Program Counter
  AC           38           Accumulator
  MQ           36           Multiplier-Quotient
  SW1..SW6     1            Sense Switches 1..6
  SW           6            Sense Switches
  SL1..4       1            Sense Lights 1..4
  ACOVF        1            AC Overflow Indicator
  DVC          1            Divide Check Indicator
  IOC          1            I/O Check Indicator
  ------------ ------------ ------------------------

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU
HISTORY commands:

  -------------------- --------------------------------------
  SET CPU HISTORY      clear history buffer
  SET CPU HISTORY=0    disable history
  SET CPU HISTORY=n    enable history, length = n
  SHOW CPU HISTORY     print CPU history
  SHOW CPU HISTORY=n   print first n entries of CPU history
  -------------------- --------------------------------------

3.2 I/O Channel (CH)
--------------------

The channel device on the 701 is only used by simulator, and has no
controls or registers.

3.3 Peripherals
---------------

### 3.3.1 711 Card Reader (CDR)

The card reader (CDR) reads data from a disk file. Cards are simulated
as ASCII lines with terminating newlines. Card reader files can either
be text (one character per column) or column binary (two characters per
column). The file type can be specified with a set command:

  ----------------------- -------------------------------------
  SET CDR FORMAT=TEXT     Sets ASCII text mode
  SET CDR FORMAT=BINARY   Sets for binary card images.
  SET CDR FORMAT=BCD      Sets for BCD records.
  SET CDR FORMAT=CBN      Sets for column binary BCD records.
  SET CDR FORMAT=AUTO     Automatically determines format.
  ----------------------- -------------------------------------

or in the ATTACH command:

  ------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ATTACH CDR *\<file\>*                 Attaches a file
  ATTACH CDR -f *\<format\> \<file\>*   Attaches a file with the given format.
  ATTACH CDR -s \<*file*\>              Added file onto current cards to read.
  ATTACH CDR -e \<*file\>*              After file is read in, the reader will receive and end of file flag.
  ------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The card reader can be booted with the:

  ---------- ------------------------------
  BOOT CDR   Loads first 3 words of card.
  ---------- ------------------------------

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached report error and stop

end of file out of cards

OS I/O error report error and stop

### 3.3.2 721 Card Punch (CDP)

The card reader (CDP) writes data to a disk file. Cards are simulated as
ASCII lines with terminating newlines. Card punch files can either be
text (one character per column) or column binary (two characters per
column). The file type can be specified with a set command:

  ----------------------- -------------------------------------
  SET CDP FORMAT=TEXT     Sets ASCII text mode
  SET CDP FORMAT=BINARY   Sets for binary card images.
  SET CDP FORMAT=BCD      Sets for BCD records.
  SET CDP FORMAT=CBN      Sets for column binary BCD records.
  SET CDP FORMAT=AUTO     Automatically determines format.
  ----------------------- -------------------------------------

or in the ATTACH command:

  ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
  ATTACH CDP \<file\>                 Attaches a file
  ATTACH CDP -f \<format\> \<file\>   Attaches a file with the given format.
  ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------------

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached report error and stop

OS I/O error report error and stop

### 3.3.3 716 Line Printer (LP)

The line printer (LP) writes data to a disk file as ASCII text with
terminating newlines. Currently set to handle standard signals to
control paper advance.

  --------------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  SET LP NO/ECHO              Sets echoing to console of line-printer output.
  SET LP LINESPERPAGE=*lpp*   Sets number of lines per page on printer.
  --------------------------- -------------------------------------------------

The Printer supports the following SPRA *n* selection pulses for
controlling spacing (spacing occurs before the line is printed):

  -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  SPRA 1   To top of form.
  SPRA 2   Single space.
  SPRA 3   Double space. Before printing line.
  SPRA 4   Triple space. Before printing line.
  SPRA 9   Suppress linefeed after print. Prints characters 73-120
           
  SPT      Will skip if any printer line has been pulsed.
  -------- ---------------------------------------------------------

Default with no SPRA is to single space before printing.

Error handling is as follows:

error processed as

not attached report error and stop

OS I/O error report error and stop

### 3.3.4 729 Magnetic Tape (MT)

These come in groups of 10 units each. MT0 is unit 10.

Each individual tape drive support several options: MTA used as an
example.

  ----------------------- --------------------------------------
  SET MT*n* REWIND        Sets the mag tape to the load point.
  SET MT*n* LOCKED        Sets the mag tape to be read only.
  SET MT*n* WRITEENABLE   Sets the mag tape to be writable.
  SET MT*n* LOW           Sets mag tape to low density.
  SET MT*n* HIGH          Sets mag tape to high density.
  ----------------------- --------------------------------------

Options: Density LOW/HIGH does not change format of how tapes are
written. And is only for informational purposes only.

Tape drives can be booted with:

  ------------ --------------------------------------
  BOOT MT*n*   Read in first three words of record.
  ------------ --------------------------------------

### 2.3.4 733 Drum (DR)

Up to 16 units can be attached to the CPU, all are on pseudo channel 0.
Each drum is 2048K words in size. They are all stored in one file.

  ------------------- ----------------------------------------------
  SET DR0 UNITS=*n*   Set number of units to of storage to attach.
  ------------------- ----------------------------------------------

Drum unit 0 can be booted with:

  ----------- --------------------------------------
  BOOT DR0n   Read in first three words of record.
  ----------- --------------------------------------

4 Symbolic Display and Input
============================

The IBM 701 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are
controlled by the following switches to the EXAMINE and DEPOSIT
commands:

  ---- -------------------------------------
  -m   Display/Enter Symbolic Machine Code
  -c   Display/Enter BCD Characters
       Display/Enter Octal data.
  ---- -------------------------------------

The symbolic input/display supports 1 format for instruction display:

-   \<opcode\>,\<sign\>\<octal address\>,\<opcode\>,\<sign\>\<octal
    address\>

A negative address specifies the lower 18 bits of the given memory
location.

5 Sim Load
==========

The load command looks at the extension of the file to determine how to
load the file.

+------+---------------------------------------------+
| .crd | Loads a card image file into memory.        |
|      |                                             |
