# TX-0 Features

The TX-0 is configured as follows:

> device name(s) simulates
> 
> CPU TX-0 CPU with up to 64KW of memory
> 
> PETR Photo Electric Tape Rader
> 
> PTP Paper Tape Punch
> 
> TTI FlexoWriter input
> 
> TTO FlexoWriter output
> 
> DPY 512x512 7” high-persistence phosphor CRT Display

The TX-0 simulator implements the following unique stop conditions:

  - An unimplemented operator is referenced, and register STOP\_OPR is
    set

  - An invalid interrupt request is made

The LOAD commands has an optional argument to specify the load address:

LOAD \<filename\> {\<starting address\>}

The LOAD command loads a paper-tape bootstrap format file at the
specified address. If no address is specified, loading starts at
location 200. The DUMP command is not supported.

## CPU

The TX-0 was upgraded over the years from the original 1956 “Standard”
instruction set to a later “Extended” instruction set completed in 1962.
In addition, the TX-0 CPU can operate in one of three operating modes:

Read In Mode Instruction words are fetched from the tape.

Test Mode Instruction words are fetched from the TBR.

Normal Mode Instruction words are fetched from memory.

only CPU options are the presence of the extended arithmetic operator
and the size of main memory.

SET CPU TX0STD set CPU model to TX-0 “Standard.”

SET CPU TX0EXT set CPU model to TX-0 “Extended.”

SET CPU NORMAL set CPU mode to Normal Mode

SET CPU TEST set CPU Mode to Test Mode

SET CPU READIN set CPU Mode to Read In Mode

SET CPU 4K set memory size = 4K (T-Memory)

SET CPU 8K set memory size = 8K (T-Memory)

SET CPU 64K set memory size = 64K (Core Memory)

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 64K. The
default configuration is a TX-0 with AO, EAO, and GPR.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

## I/O Devices

The TX-0 includes several I/O devices, and unlike more modern machines,
these devices are not memory or I/O mapped, but rather have specific CPU
operate orders to access them.

### Photoelectric Tape Reader (PETR)

The PETR is a 250 line per minute Ferranti photoelectric paper tape
reader using standard seven-hole Flexowriter tape that was modified to
solid state circuitry. Lines without seventh hole punched are ignored by
the PETR. As each line of the tape is read in, the data is stored into
an 18-bit BUF register with bits mapped as follows:

Tape BUF

1.  0

2.  3

3.  6

4.  9

5.  12

6.  15

Up to three lines of tape may be read into a single the single BUF
register. Before subsequent lines are read, the BUF register is cycled
one bit right.

The PETR reads data from or a disk file. The POS register specifies the
number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by changing POS, the user
can backspace or advance the reader.

The PETR supports the BOOT command. BOOT PETR switches the CPU to
Read-In mode, and starts the processor running.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 18 18-bit buffer to store up to three lines of

> Paper tape input

POS 32 position in the input file

### Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) punches standard seven-hole Flexowriter tape.
The POS register specifies the number of the next data item to be
written. Thus, by changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the
punch.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 8 last data item processed

POS 32 position in the output file

### Console Typewriter Input (TTI), Output (TTO)

The Typewriter is a half-duplex electric Friden Flexowriter typewriter.
The typewriter input (TTI) polls the console keyboard for input. The
typewriter output (TTO) writes to the simulator console window. On
input, TTI converts the ASCII character received from the keyboard to
Flexowriter code. On output, the TTO converts the Flexowriter code to
ASCII for display on the simulator console window.

The typewriter input implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 6 typewriter buffer (shared)

UC 1 upper case/lower case state (shared)

DONE 1 input ready flag

POS 32 number of characters input

TIME 24 keyboard polling interval

The typewriter output implements these registers:

name size comments

BUF 6 typewriter buffer (shared)

UC 1 upper case/lower case state (shared)

RPLS 1 return restart pulse flag

DONE 1 output done flag

POS 32 number of characters output

TIME 24 time from I/O initiation to interrupt

### Display (DPY)

In 1957, a 10 inch, electro-static deflection, cathode ray tube, having
512 by 512 addressable locations, in a 7 by 7 inch raster, point by
point display system was installed on the TX-0. In simulation, the
display is accomplished using a separate graphical display window.

The display is accessed via the DIS order, with the coordinate specified
in the AC. DIS will intensify a point with x and y coordinates where X
is specified by AC digits 0-8, and Y is specified by AC digits 9-17. Bit
0 is the sign for X, and bit 9 is the sign for Y. The complement system
is in effect when signs are negative.

### Light Pen (PEN)

In 1958, a Light-Pen, a solid state version of an idea being developed
for the Sage System, was added to the TX-0. The light pen status is read
using the PEN order, with light pen flip-flops 1 and 2 being read into
AC positions 0 and 1 respectively.

In simulation, the light pen is implemented using a computer mouse or
touch screen.

# TX-0 Usage Examples

Several example tapes can be used to test the TX-0 simulation.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The tic-tac-toe game can be run using the tic.simh startup script:

> ; TX-0 Initialization file for the tic-tac-toe game
> 
> set dpy enable
> 
> att petr bin\_tic-tac-toe\_new\_code\_12-16-61.bin
> 
> boot petr
> 
> g

In this game, you simply use the light pen (mouse) to select where you
want to place the “X” (the TX-0 is “O.”). You must click right on top of
or very close to the dot in the center of the square you want to place
your “X” into.

### MOUSE Game

The MOUSE game, written by John E. Ward is a more complex game with
requires involvement not only with the light pen, but also the TAC. In
simulation, the TAC can be accessed by stopping the simulation and using
the Deposit command to change the value of the TAC to select various
modes.

Here is the configuration file, mouse.simh:

> ; TX-0 Initialization file for the Mouse Maze Game
> 
> set dpy enable
> 
> att petr bin\_newMouse\_3-22-66.bin
> 
> ; The mouse maze game mode is manipulated under TAC control.
> 
> ; 400014 = Erase Wall mode.
> 
> ; 400024 = Write Wall mode.
> 
> ; 400011 = Erase Cheese mode.
> 
> ; 400021 = Write Cheese mode.
> 
> ; 400012 = Erase Mouse mode.
> 
> ; 400022 = Write Mouse mode.
> 
> ; 400002 = "do mouse" (start the mouse searching.)
> 
> ; 400017 = "do over"
> 
> ; Start in "Erase Wall" mode
> 
> d tac 400014
> 
> boot petr

When this game starts, it is in “Erase Wall” mode. Use this mode to
create the maze, by using the computer mouse to erase unwanted walls
from the grid. When done, press Control-E to get to the simulator
command prompt, and change to “Write Cheese” mode:

> C:\\\>TX-0.exe mouse.simh
> 
> TX-0 simulator V4.0-0
> 
> mouse.simh-16\> boot petr
> 
> Simulation stopped, PC: 000161 (trn 00275 (Transfer Negative))
> 
> sim\> d tac 400021
> 
> sim\> g

Next place the cheese with the computer mouse, and then repeat the
procedure above to change the TAC to “do mouse” mode. The TX-0 should
then solve the maze. Sometimes the mouse gets stuck and is not able to
find the cheese. I tend to believe this is a bug in the simulation, but
I have not been able to find it yet.
